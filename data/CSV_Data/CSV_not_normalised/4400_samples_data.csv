Cloud and fog services leverage these data for assisting clinical procedures. IoT Healthcare has been benefited from this large pool of generated data. This paper suggests the use of low-resource machine learning on Fog devices kept close to wearables for smart telehealth. For traditional telecare systems, the signal processing and machine learning modules are deployed in the cloud that processes physiological data. This paper presents a Fog architecture that relied on unsupervised machine learning big data analysis for discovering patterns in physiological data. We developed a prototype using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that was tested on real-world pathological speech data from telemonitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Proposed architecture employed machine learning for analysis of pathological speech data obtained from smart watches worn by the patients with PD. Results show that proposed architecture is promising for low-resource machine learning. It could be useful for other applications within wearable IoT for smart telehealth scenarios by translating machine learning approaches from the cloud backend to edge computing devices such as Fog.",2017,23,63,2,true,Computer Science,19206955,Debanjan Borthakur,1732944,Harishchandra Dubey,2163090,Nicholas Constant,39541546,L.

The interest in learning-based methods for security and system design applications comes from the high degree of complexity of phenomena underlying the security and reliability of computer systems. As it becomes increasingly difficult to reach the desired properties by design alone, learning methods are being used to obtain a better understanding of various data collected from these complex systems. 
 
However, learning approaches can be co-opted or evaded by adversaries, who change to counter them. To-date, there has been limited research into learning techniques that are resilient to attacks with provable robustness guarantees making the task of designing secure learning-based systems a lucrative open 
research area with many challenges. 
 
The Perspectives Workshop, ``Machine Learning Methods for Computer Security'' was convened to bring together interested researchers from both the computer security and machine learning communities to discuss techniques, challenges, and future research directions for secure learning and learning-based security applications. 
 
This workshop featured twenty-two invited talks from leading researchers within the secure learning community covering topics in adversarial learning, game-theoretic learning, collective classification, privacy-preserving learning, security evaluation metrics, digital forensics, authorship identification, adversarial advertisement detection, learning for offensive security, and data sanitization.

Bansak et al. used a machine learning approach to develop an algorithm for geographically placing refugees to optimize their overall employment rate. The authors developed and tested the algorithm on segments of registry data from the United States and Switzerland. The algorithm improved the employment prospects of refugees in the United States by ∼40% and in Switzerland by ∼75%. Science, this issue p. 325 A machine learning–based algorithm for assigning refugees can improve their employment prospects over current approaches. Developed democracies are settling an increased number of refugees, many of whom face challenges integrating into host societies. We developed a flexible data-driven algorithm that assigns refugees across resettlement locations to improve integration outcomes. The algorithm uses a combination of supervised machine learning and optimal matching to discover and leverage synergies between refugee characteristics and resettlement sites. The algorithm was tested on historical registry data from two countries with different assignment regimes and refugee populations, the United States and Switzerland. Our approach led to gains of roughly 40 to 70%, on average, in refugees’ employment outcomes relative to current assignment practices. This approach can provide governments with a practical and cost-efficient policy tool that can be immediately implemented within existing institutional structures.",2018,38,161,17,false,Medicine,8074481,Kirk Bansak,35299236,Jeremy Ferwerda,4600197,Jens Hainmueller,50033874,Andrea Dillon,4026563,Dominik Hangartner,39523274,Duncan Lawrence,2223030,J.

(difference of convex functions) programs as a sequence of convex programs. In machine learning, CCCP is extensively used in many learning algorithms like sparse support vector machines (SVMs), transductive SVMs, sparse principal component analysis, etc. Though widely used in many applications, the convergence behavior of CCCP has not gotten a lot of specific attention. Yuille and Rangarajan analyzed its convergence in their original paper, however, we believe the analysis is not complete. Although the convergence of CCCP can be derived from the convergence of the d.c. algorithm (DCA), its proof is more specialized and technical than actually required for the specific case of CCCP. In this paper, we follow a different reasoning and show how Zangwill's global convergence theory of iterative algorithms provides a natural framework to prove the convergence of CCCP, allowing a more elegant and simple proof. This underlines Zangwill's theory as a powerful and general framework to deal with the convergence issues of iterative algorithms, after also being used to prove the convergence of algorithms like expectation-maximization, generalized alternating minimization, etc. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence of CCCP by addressing these questions: (i) When does CCCP find a local minimum or a stationary point of the d.c. program under consideration? (ii) When does the sequence generated by CCCP converge? We also present an open problem on the issue of local convergence of CCCP.",2009,36,418,42,false,Computer Science,3313411,Bharath K.

For strongly convex problems, its convergence rate was known to be O(log(T)/T), by running SGD for T iterations and returning the average point. However, recent results showed that using a different algorithm, one can get an optimal O(1/T) rate. This might lead one to believe that standard SGD is suboptimal, and maybe should even be replaced as a method of choice. In this paper, we investigate the optimality of SGD in a stochastic setting. We show that for smooth problems, the algorithm attains the optimal O(1/T) rate. However, for non-smooth problems, the convergence rate with averaging might really be Ω(log(T)/T), and this is not just an artifact of the analysis. On the flip side, we show that a simple modification of the averaging step suffices to recover the O(1/T) rate, and no other change of the algorithm is necessary. We also present experimental results which support our findings, and point out open problems.",2011,17,597,73,false,Computer Science,1680046,A. Rakhlin,1768909,O.

They are also extremely accurate because they can efficiently handle the nonlinear local color distributions by incorporating the kernel trick, that are beyond the ability of many previous works.

Users of cloud services are under constant fear of data loss, security threats and availability issues. Recently, learning-based methods for security applications are gaining popularity in the literature with the advents in machine learning techniques. However, the major challenge in these methods is obtaining real-time and unbiased datasets. Many datasets are internal and cannot be shared due to privacy issues or may lack certain statistical characteristics. As a result of this, researchers prefer to generate datasets for training and testing purpose in the simulated or closed experimental environments which may lack comprehensiveness. Machine learning models trained with such a single dataset generally result in a semantic gap between results and their application. There is a dearth of research work which demonstrates the effectiveness of these models across multiple datasets obtained in different environments. We argue that it is necessary to test the robustness of the machine learning models, especially in diversified operating conditions, which are prevalent in cloud scenarios. In this work, we use the UNSW dataset to train the supervised machine learning models. We then test these models with ISOT dataset. We present our results and argue that more research in the field of machine learning is still required for its applicability to the cloud security.",2016,31,57,5,true,Computer Science,3116378,D.

They are becoming increasingly important in the biological sciences for the tasks of inferring cellular networks [1], modelling protein signalling pathways [2], systems biology, data integration [3], classification [4], and genetic data analysis [5]. The representation and use of probability theory makes BNs suitable for combining domain knowledge and data, expressing causal relationships, avoiding overfitting a model to training data, and learning from incomplete datasets. The probabilistic formalism provides a natural treatment for the stochastic nature of biological systems and measurements. This primer aims to introduce BNs to the computational biologist, focusing on the concepts behind methods for learning the parameters and structure of models, at a time when they are becoming the machine learning method of choice. 
 
There are many applications in biology where we wish to classify data; for example, gene function prediction. To solve such problems, a set of rules are required that can be used for prediction, but often such knowledge is unavailable, or in practice there turn out to be many exceptions to the rules or so many rules that this approach produces poor results. 
 
Machine learning approaches often produce better results, where a large number of examples (the training set) is used to adapt the parameters of a model that can then be used for performing predictions or classifications on data. There are many different types of models that may be required and many different approaches to training the models, each with its pros and cons. An excellent overview of the topic can be found in [6] and [7]. Neural networks, for example, are often able to learn a model from training data, but it is often difficult to extract information about the model, which with other methods can provide valuable insights into the data or problem being solved. A common problem in machine learning is overfitting, where the learned model is too complex and generalises poorly to unseen data. Increasing the size of the training dataset may reduce this; however, this assumes more training data is readily available, which is often not the case. In addition, often it is important to determine the uncertainty in the learned model parameters or even in the choice of model. This primer focuses on the use of BNs, which offer a solution to these issues. The use of Bayesian probability theory provides mechanisms for describing uncertainty and for adapting the number of parameters to the size of the data. Using a graphical representation provides a simple way to visualise the structure of a model. Inspection of models can provide valuable insights into the properties of the data and allow new models to be produced.",2007,18,276,7,true,Computer Science,4505078,C. Needham,47086417,J.

A genetic algorithm is employed to derive control rules encoded as decision tables. Next, the rules are automatically transformed into comprehensible form by means of inductive machine learning. Finally, a genetic algorithm is applied again to optimize the numerical parameters of the induced rules. The approach is experimentally verified on a benchmark problem of inverted pendulum control, with special emphasis on robustness and reliability. It is also shown that the proposed framework enables exploiting available domain knowledge. In this case, genetic algorithm makes qualitative control rules operational by providing interpretation of symbols in terms of numerical values. >",1993,10,239,6,false,Computer Science,1931927,A.

The model can learn to construct and modify graphs in sophisticated ways based on textual input, and also to use the graphs to produce a variety of outputs.

The algorithm is inspired by human metacognitive learning principles and has two components: a cognitive component and a metacognitive component. The cognitive component is a single-hidden-layer radial basis function network with evolving architecture. The metacognitive component controls the learning process in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions and past knowledge of the samples in the form of pseudosamples are used for proper initialization of new hidden neurons to minimize the misclassification. The parameter update strategy uses projection-based direct minimization of hinge loss error. The interaction of the cognitive component and the metacognitive component addresses the what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn human learning principles efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set of benchmark classification problems from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The statistical performance evaluation on these problems proves the superior performance of the PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. Also, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a practical Alzheimer's disease detection problem. The performance results on open access series of imaging studies and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative datasets, which are obtained from different demographic regions, clearly show that PBL-McRBFN can handle a problem with change in distribution.",2013,50,110,5,false,Computer Science,34094551,G.

During the past few decades, considerable effort has been devoted towards improving the performance of TE materials, which requires the optimization of multiple interrelated properties. A fundamental understanding of the interaction processes between the various energy carriers, such as electrons and phonons, is critical for advances in the development of TE materials. However, this understanding remains challenging primarily due to the inaccessibility of time scales using standard atomistic simulations. Machine learning methods, well known for their data‐analysis capability, have been successfully applied in research on TE materials in recent years. Here, an overview of the machine learning methods used in thermoelectric studies is provided, with the role that each machine learning method plays being systematically discussed. Furthermore, to date, the scale of thermoelectric‐related databases is much smaller than those in other fields, such as e‐commerce, image identification, and speech recognition. To overcome this limitation, possible strategies to utilize small databases in promoting materials science are also discussed.

While spontaneous passivation of their reactive bare surfaces lends unprecedented functionalities, consequently a many-folds increase in number of possible functionalized MXene makes their characterization difficult. Here, we study the electronic properties of this vast class of materials by accurately estimating the band gaps using statistical learning. Using easily available properties of the MXene, namely, boiling and melting points, atomic radii, phases, bond lengths, etc., as input features, models were developed using kernel ridge (KRR), support vector (SVR), Gaussian process (GPR), and bootstrap aggregating regression algorithms. Among these, the GPR model predicts the band gap with lowest root-mean-squared error (rmse) of 0.14 eV, within seconds.

In this paper, we propose to measure image similarity by learning from the online Flickr image groups. We do so by: Choosing 103 Flickr groups, building a one-versus-all multiclass classifier to classify test images into a group, taking the set of responses of the classifiers as features, calculating the distance between feature vectors to measure image similarity. Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data. We adopt an SVM classifier with a histogram intersection kernel. We describe a novel fast training algorithm for this classifier: the Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm.

Machine-learning may offer potential to explore outcomes of even greater complexity, such as premature death. This study aimed to develop novel prediction algorithms using machine-learning, in addition to standard survival modelling, to predict premature all-cause mortality. Methods A prospective population cohort of 502,628 participants aged 40–69 years were recruited to the UK Biobank from 2006–2010 and followed-up until 2016. Participants were assessed on a range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle factors. Mortality data by ICD-10 were obtained from linkage to Office of National Statistics. Models were developed using deep learning, random forest and Cox regression. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed to predicted risks; and discrimination by area under the ‘receiver operating curve’ (AUC). Findings 14,418 deaths (2.9%) occurred over a total follow-up time of 3,508,454 person-years. A simple age and gender Cox model was the least predictive (AUC 0.689, 95% CI 0.681–0.699). A multivariate Cox regression model significantly improved discrimination by 6.2% (AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.748–0.767). The application of machine-learning algorithms further improved discrimination by 3.2% using random forest (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.776–0.791) and 3.9% using deep learning (AUC 0.790, 95% CI 0.783–0.797). These ML algorithms improved discrimination by 9.4% and 10.1% respectively from a simple age and gender Cox regression model. Random forest and deep learning achieved similar levels of discrimination with no significant difference. Machine-learning algorithms were well-calibrated, while Cox regression models consistently over-predicted risk. Conclusions Machine-learning significantly improved accuracy of prediction of premature all-cause mortality in this middle-aged population, compared to standard methods. This study illustrates the value of machine-learning for risk prediction within a traditional epidemiological study design, and how this approach might be reported to assist scientific verification.",2019,38,58,0,true,Medicine,8955394,S.

Results Our study showed that the best cutoff of HOMA-IR for identifying those with insulin resistance is 3.80. There are 39.1% individuals in this Hispanic population with HOMA-IR>3.80.

Machine learning is one of the fields responding to the challenge of this problem. 
This thesis considers the interpretation of machine learning problems and techniques under a geometric model. Geometry is a useful for several reasons. It aids in visualization, allowing for alternative ways of thinking. It provides a rigorous framework for analyzing learning problems and methods. It suggests modifications to methods which can increase their usefulness and efficiency. 
In this thesis, geometric analysis is used to formulate and analyze two theoretical machine learning problems and to improve an existing machine learning method. A form of best-case analysis is presented which can be used to generate bounds on the number of examples needed for learning. A formal trade-off between available memory and speed of learning is established. In addition, geometry is used to generalize the decision tree method of machine learning. An algorithm for learning based on this generalization is presented, and its usefulness is demonstrated on a variety of artificial and real-world databases.",1993,0,49,9,false,Computer Science,2059696865,David G.

However, the performance of machines in providing rich semantic descriptions of natural scenes from digital images remains highly limited and hugely inferior to that of humans. Here we quantify this “semantic gap” in a particular setting: We compare the efficiency of human and machine learning in assigning an image to one of two categories determined by the spatial arrangement of constituent parts. The images are not real, but the category-defining rules reflect the compositional structure of real images and the type of “reasoning” that appears to be necessary for semantic parsing.

For this purpose, four machine learning algorithms are applied based on the auto-associative neural network, factor analysis, Mahalanobis distance, and singular value decomposition. A base-excited three-story frame structure was tested in laboratory environment to obtain time-series data from an array of accelerometers under several structural state conditions. Tests were performed with varying stiffness and mass conditions with the assumption that these sources of variability are representative of changing operational and environmental conditions. Damage is simulated through nonlinear effects introduced by a bumper mechanism that induces a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. This mechanism intends to simulate the cracks that open and close under dynamic loads or loose connections that rattle.

Specifically, in addition to contrasting a given sample with other instances as in conventional contrastive learning methods, our training scheme contrasts the sample with distributionally-shifted augmentations of itself.

A variety of such tasks involves continuous physical systems, which can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs) with many degrees of freedom.

Supervised algorithms trained on raw samples of microstates can successfully detect conventional phase transitions via learning a bulk feature such as an order parameter. In this paper, we investigate whether neural networks can learn to classify phases based on topological defects. We address this question on the two-dimensional classical XY model which exhibits a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We find significant feature engineering of the raw spin states is required to convincingly claim that features of the vortex configurations are responsible for learning the transition temperature. We further show a single-layer network does not correctly classify the phases of the XY model, while a convolutional network easily performs classification by learning the global magnetization. Finally, we design a deep network capable of learning vortices without feature engineering. We demonstrate the detection of vortices does not necessarily result in the best classification accuracy, especially for lattices of less than approximately 1000 spins.

When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples.

The technique simply groups together similar patches from a noisy image (with similarity defined by a statistically motivated criterion) into a 3D stack, computes the HOSVD coefficients of this stack, manipulates these coefficients by hard thresholding, and inverts the HOSVD transform to produce the final filtered image. Our technique chooses all required parameters in a principled way, relating them to the noise model. We also discuss our motivation for adopting the HOSVD as an appropriate transform for image denoising. We experimentally demonstrate the excellent performance of the technique on grayscale as well as color images. On color images, our method produces state-of-the-art results, outperforming other color image denoising algorithms at moderately high noise levels.

Despite the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to extract valuable information from data and produce accurate predictions, it has been shown that these algorithms are vulnerable to attacks. Data poisoning is one of the most relevant security threats against machine learning systems, where attackers can subvert the learning process by injecting malicious samples in the training data. Recent work in adversarial machine learning has shown that the so-called optimal attack strategies can successfully poison linear classifiers, degrading the performance of the system dramatically after compromising a small fraction of the training dataset. In this paper we propose a defence mechanism to mitigate the effect of these optimal poisoning attacks based on outlier detection. We show empirically that the adversarial examples generated by these attack strategies are quite different from genuine points, as no detectability constrains are considered to craft the attack. Hence, they can be detected with an appropriate pre-filtering of the training dataset.",2018,35,90,11,false,Computer Science,3055305,Andrea Paudice,1399031454,Luis Muñoz-González,145350541,A.

These estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence under minimal assumptions on the dataset. The dataset may also have been corrupted by outliers on which no assumption is granted. We also analyze these new estimators with standard tools from robust statistics. In particular, we revisit the concept of breakdown point. We modify the original definition by studying the number of outliers that a dataset can contain without deteriorating the estimation properties of a given estimator. This new notion of breakdown number, that takes into account the statistical performances of the estimators, is non-asymptotic in nature and adapted for machine learning purposes. We proved that the breakdown number of our estimator is of the order of (number of observations)*(rate of convergence). For instance, the breakdown number of our estimators for the problem of estimation of a d-dimensional vector with a noise variance sigma^2 is sigma^2d and it becomes sigma^2 s log(d/s) when this vector has only s non-zero component. Beyond this breakdown point, we proved that the rate of convergence achieved by our estimator is (number of outliers) divided by (number of observation). 
Besides these theoretical guarantees, the major improvement brought by these new estimators is that they are easily computable in practice. In fact, basically any algorithm used to approximate the standard Empirical Risk Minimizer (or its regularized versions) has a robust version approximating our estimators. As a proof of concept, we study many algorithms for the classical LASSO estimator. A byproduct of the MOM algorithms is a measure of depth of data that can be used to detect outliers.",2017,116,112,13,true,Mathematics,2084337661,G. Lecu'e,2202029,M.

This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation.

This has in part contributed to long wait times for a diagnosis and subsequent delays in access to therapy. We hypothesize that the use of machine learning analysis on home video can speed the diagnosis without compromising accuracy. We have analyzed item-level records from 2 standard diagnostic instruments to construct machine learning classifiers optimized for sparsity, interpretability, and accuracy. In the present study, we prospectively test whether the features from these optimized models can be extracted by blinded nonexpert raters from 3-minute home videos of children with and without ASD to arrive at a rapid and accurate machine learning autism classification. Methods and findings We created a mobile web portal for video raters to assess 30 behavioral features (e.g., eye contact, social smile) that are used by 8 independent machine learning models for identifying ASD, each with >94% accuracy in cross-validation testing and subsequent independent validation from previous work. We then collected 116 short home videos of children with autism (mean age = 4 years 10 months, SD = 2 years 3 months) and 46 videos of typically developing children (mean age = 2 years 11 months, SD = 1 year 2 months). Three raters blind to the diagnosis independently measured each of the 30 features from the 8 models, with a median time to completion of 4 minutes. Although several models (consisting of alternating decision trees, support vector machine [SVM], logistic regression (LR), radial kernel, and linear SVM) performed well, a sparse 5-feature LR classifier (LR5) yielded the highest accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 92% [95% CI 88%–97%]) across all ages tested. We used a prospectively collected independent validation set of 66 videos (33 ASD and 33 non-ASD) and 3 independent rater measurements to validate the outcome, achieving lower but comparable accuracy (AUC: 89% [95% CI 81%–95%]). Finally, we applied LR to the 162-video-feature matrix to construct an 8-feature model, which achieved 0.93 AUC (95% CI 0.90–0.97) on the held-out test set and 0.86 on the validation set of 66 videos. Validation on children with an existing diagnosis limited the ability to generalize the performance to undiagnosed populations. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that feature tagging of home videos for machine learning classification of autism can yield accurate outcomes in short time frames, using mobile devices. Further work will be needed to confirm that this approach can accelerate autism diagnosis at scale.",2018,51,103,8,true,Computer Science,51995164,Q. Tariq,34240128,J. Daniels,20482280,J.

In particular, increased use of so-called in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and partially autonomous driving assistance systems (PADAS) have raised important and growing safety concerns. Thus, detecting the driver's state is of paramount importance, to adapt IVIS and PADAS accordingly, therefore avoiding or mitigating their possible negative effects. The purpose of this paper is to show a method for the nonintrusive and real-time detection of visual distraction, using vehicle dynamics data and without using the eye-tracker data as inputs to classifiers. Specifically, we present and compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task [i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods, providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects.

Robots have the potential to facilitate future therapies for children on the autism spectrum. However, existing robots are limited in their ability to automatically perceive and respond to human affect, which is necessary for establishing and maintaining engaging interactions. Their inference challenge is made even harder by the fact that many individuals with autism have atypical and unusually diverse styles of expressing their affective-cognitive states. To tackle the heterogeneity in children with autism, we used the latest advances in deep learning to formulate a personalized machine learning (ML) framework for automatic perception of the children’s affective states and engagement during robot-assisted autism therapy. Instead of using the traditional one-size-fits-all ML approach, we personalized our framework to each child using their contextual information (demographics and behavioral assessment scores) and individual characteristics. We evaluated this framework on a multimodal (audio, video, and autonomic physiology) data set of 35 children (ages 3 to 13) with autism, from two cultures (Asia and Europe), and achieved an average agreement (intraclass correlation) of ~60% with human experts in the estimation of affect and engagement, also outperforming nonpersonalized ML solutions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of robot perception of affect and engagement in children with autism and have implications for the design of future autism therapies.",2018,125,183,7,false,Psychology,143776835,Ognjen Rudovic,77537854,Jaeryoung Lee,1392261251,Miles Dai,145411696,Björn Schuller,1719389,Rosalind W.

There have been many reports of functional and anatomical connectivity being altered while individuals with autism are engaged in complex cognitive and social tasks. Although disrupted instantaneous correlation between cortical regions observed from functional MRI is considered to be an explanatory model for autism, the causal influence of a brain area on another (effective connectivity) is a vital link missing in these studies. The current study focuses on addressing this in an fMRI study of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) in 15 high-functioning adolescents and adults with autism and 15 typically developing control participants. Participants viewed a series of comic strip vignettes in the MRI scanner and were asked to choose the most logical end to the story from three alternatives, separately for trials involving physical and intentional causality. The mean time series, extracted from 18 activated regions of interest, were processed using a multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR) to obtain the causality matrices for each of the 30 participants. These causal connectivity weights, along with assessment scores, functional connectivity values, and fractional anisotropy obtained from DTI data for each participant, were submitted to a recursive cluster elimination based support vector machine classifier to determine the accuracy with which the classifier can predict a novel participant's group membership (autism or control). We found a maximum classification accuracy of 95.9% with 19 features which had the highest discriminative ability between the groups. All of the 19 features were effective connectivity paths, indicating that causal information may be critical in discriminating between autism and control groups. These effective connectivity paths were also found to be significantly greater in controls as compared to ASD participants and consisted predominantly of outputs from the fusiform face area and middle temporal gyrus indicating impaired connectivity in ASD participants, particularly in the social brain areas. These findings collectively point toward the fact that alterations in causal connectivity in the brain in ASD could serve as a potential non-invasive neuroimaging signature for autism.",2013,99,143,9,true,Psychology,143879680,G.

However, computational approaches have emerged as a time- and cost-efficient way to prioritize combinations to test, based on recently available large-scale combination screening data. Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-the-art model performance. However, Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction, which is the approach we present here, termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies. Results DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore, we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines, which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset. We envision that DeepSynergy could be a valuable tool for selecting novel synergistic drug combinations.

In recent years, significant effort has been focused on this issue. However, most of the methods extract the features of original data in a shallow manner.

A new feature extraction (FE) and image classification framework are proposed for hyperspectral data analysis based on deep belief network (DBN). First, we verify the eligibility of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and DBN by the following spectral information-based classification. Then, we propose a novel deep architecture, which combines the spectral-spatial FE and classification together to get high classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical learning-based FE, and logistic regression (LR).

While there are many methods to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat blind to new DGA variants. In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect. In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based generative adversarial network. In particular, our deep learning architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector + generator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve convergence.",2016,27,163,23,false,Computer Science,2639880,H.

We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.",2016,25,146,37,true,Computer Science,1700325,Graham Neubig,1979489,Kyunghyun Cho,3016273,Jiatao Gu,2052674293,V.

We have collaborated with teachers in the Detroit Public School System to design project-based curriculum materials that contextualize the learning of science in meaningful real-world problems, engage students in science inquiry, and use learning tech- nologies. We present a sixth grade project-based science unit in which students explored the driving question ''How Do Machines Help Me Build Big Things?'' and address the science learning goals of balanced and unbalanced forces, simple and complex machines, and mechanical advantage. Twenty-four teachers and over 2500 students in Detroit participated in enactments of this project over 4 years. Student learning outcomes were determined for the three learning goals and inquiry process skills using pre- and postachievement tests. Achievement outcomes as measured by the pre/posttest show significant and con- sistently high learning gains, even as participation in the project increased to include greater numbers of teachers and students in successive enactments, and leadership of the professional development support for this project transitioned from university researchers to district teacher leaders. These results illustrate that materials which contextualize learning and support student inquiry as part of an urban systemic reform effort can promote learning of important and meaningful science content aligned with standards. 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These upper bounds are tight at the current estimate, and each iteration monotonically drives the objective function downhill. Such a simple principle is widely applicable and has been very popular in various scientific fields, especially in signal processing and statistics. We propose an incremental majorization-minimization scheme for minimizing a large sum of continuous functions, a problem of utmost importance in machine learning. We present convergence guarantees for nonconvex and convex optimization when the upper bounds approximate the objective up to a smooth error; we call such upper bounds “first-order surrogate functions.” More precisely, we study asymptotic stationary point guarantees for nonconvex problems, and for convex ones, we provide convergence rates for the expected objective function value. We apply our scheme to composite optimization and obtain a new incremental proximal gradient algorithm with linear convergence rate for strongly convex functions. Our experiments show that our method is competitive with the state of the art for solving machine learning problems such as logistic regression when the number of training samples is large enough, and we demonstrate its usefulness for sparse estimation with nonconvex penalties.",2014,64,264,35,true,Computer Science,2599292,J.

Zeno generalizes previous results that assumed a majority of non-faulty nodes; we need assume only one non-faulty worker. Our key idea is to suspect workers that are potentially defective. Since this is likely to lead to false positives, we use a ranking-based preference mechanism. We prove the convergence of SGD for non-convex problems under these scenarios. Experimental results show that Zeno outperforms existing approaches.",2018,15,116,25,false,Computer Science,144586627,Cong Xie,143812875,O.

We present the Kymatio software package, an easy-to-use, high-performance Python implementation of the scattering transform in 1D, 2D, and 3D that is compatible with modern deep learning frameworks. All transforms may be executed on a GPU (in addition to CPU), offering a considerable speed up over CPU implementations.

In this paper, we propose an active learning approach in which the machine solicits ""labels"" on features rather than instances. In both simulated and real user experiments on two sequence labeling tasks we show that our active learning method outperforms passive learning with features as well as traditional active learning with instances. Preliminary experiments suggest that novel interfaces which intelligently solicit labels on multiple features facilitate more efficient annotation.",2009,19,168,9,true,Computer Science,2476903,Gregory Druck,1717452,Burr Settles,143753639,A.

But data in real-world is usually imbalanced. The class imbalance problem is pervasive and ubiquitous, causing trouble to a large segment of the data mining community. The tradition machine learning algorithms have bad performance when they learn from imbalanced data sets. Thus, machine learning on imbalanced data sets becomes an urgent problem. The importance of imbalanced data sets and their broad application domains in data mining are introduced, and then methods to deal with the class imbalance problem are discussed and their effectiveness are compared. Last but not least, the existing evaluation measures of class imbalance problem are systematically analyzed.",2008,29,91,6,false,Computer Science,2054919287,Qiong Gu,145126412,Z.

These methods predict compounds of specific pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic or toxicological properties based on their structure-derived structural and physicochemical properties. Increasing attention has been directed at these methods because of their capability in predicting compounds of diverse structures and complex structure-activity relationships without requiring the knowledge of target 3D structure. This article reviews current progresses in using machine learning methods for virtual screening of pharmacodynamically active compounds from large compound libraries, and analyzes and compares the reported performances of machine learning tools with those of structure-based and other ligand-based (such as pharmacophore and clustering) virtual screening methods. The feasibility to improve the performance of machine learning methods in screening large libraries is discussed.",2009,12,56,2,false,Medicine,39307058,X. H. Ma,2888440,J. Jia,2075368283,F.
