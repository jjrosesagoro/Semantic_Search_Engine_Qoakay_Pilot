The price data is sourced from the Bitcoin Price Index. The task is achieved with varying degrees of success through the implementation of a Bayesian optimised recurrent neural network (RNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 52% and a RMSE of 8%. The popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting is implemented as a comparison to the deep learning models. As expected, the non-linear deep learning methods outperform the ARIMA forecast which performs poorly. Finally, both deep learning models are benchmarked on both a GPU and a CPU with the training time on the GPU outperforming the CPU implementation by 67.7%.",2018,56,335,26,true,Computer Science,46391717,S.

Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms. In this work two of the prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are investigated on four popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using publicly available Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset from University of California and Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimentation results prove that PCA outperforms LDA in all the measures. Also, the performance of the classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest examined is not affected much by using PCA and LDA.To further analyze the performance of PCA and LDA the eperimentation is carried out on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets. Experimentation results prove that ML algorithms with PCA produce better results when dimensionality of the datasets is high. When dimensionality of datasets is low it is observed that the ML algorithms without dimensionality reduction yields better results.",2020,44,245,7,true,Computer Science,38608914,G. T.

A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actually prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a simple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to capture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by decoupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.",2008,39,494,90,false,Computer Science,39799304,J.

Achieving this ambitious goal requires new radio techniques for adaptive learning and intelligent decision making because of the complex heterogeneous nature of the network structures and wireless services. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have great success in supporting big data analytics, efficient parameter estimation and interactive decision making. Hence, in this article, we review the thirty-year history of ML by elaborating on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning.

Then, a series of new algorithms for various machine learning tasks, e.g., data clustering, subspace learning, and semi-supervised learning, are derived upon the ¿1-graphs. Compared with the conventional k -nearest-neighbor graph and ¿-ball graph, the ¿1-graph possesses the advantages: (1) greater robustness to data noise, (2) automatic sparsity, and (3) adaptive neighborhood for individual datum.

Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation.

Computers learn how to recognize patterns, make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic environment. Certain trained machines may be more effective than others because they are based on more suitable ML algorithms or because they were trained through superior training sets. Although ML algorithms are known and publicly released, training sets may not be reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be guarded as trade secrets. While much research has been performed about the privacy of the elements of training sets, in this paper we focus our attention on ML classifiers and on the statistical information that can be unconsciously or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is possible to infer unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular, we build a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining meaningful information about their training sets.

Deep models, typically over-parametrized, tend to fit the training data exactly. Despite this ""overfitting"", they perform well on test data, a phenomenon not yet fully understood. 
The first point of our paper is that strong performance of overfitted classifiers is not a unique feature of deep learning. Using six real-world and two synthetic datasets, we establish experimentally that kernel machines trained to have zero classification or near zero regression error perform very well on test data, even when the labels are corrupted with a high level of noise. We proceed to give a lower bound on the norm of zero loss solutions for smooth kernels, showing that they increase nearly exponentially with data size. We point out that this is difficult to reconcile with the existing generalization bounds. Moreover, none of the bounds produce non-trivial results for interpolating solutions. 
Second, we show experimentally that (non-smooth) Laplacian kernels easily fit random labels, a finding that parallels results for ReLU neural networks. In contrast, fitting noisy data requires many more epochs for smooth Gaussian kernels. Similar performance of overfitted Laplacian and Gaussian classifiers on test, suggests that generalization is tied to the properties of the kernel function rather than the optimization process. 
Certain key phenomena of deep learning are manifested similarly in kernel methods in the modern ""overfitted"" regime. The combination of the experimental and theoretical results presented in this paper indicates a need for new theoretical ideas for understanding properties of classical kernel methods. We argue that progress on understanding deep learning will be difficult until more tractable ""shallow"" kernel methods are better understood.",2018,57,296,27,false,Computer Science,145520115,Mikhail Belkin,143791100,Siyuan Ma,151213231,Soumik Mandal,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The supervised machine learning approach has been widely applied to bioinformatics and gained a lot of success in this research area. With this learning approach researchers first develop a large training set, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover, the proportion of the positive examples and negative examples in the training set may not represent the real-world data distribution, which causes concept drift. Active learning avoids these problems. Unlike most conventional learning methods where the training set used to derive the model remains static, the classifier can actively choose the training data and the size of training set increases. We introduced an algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machine and applied the algorithm to gene expression profiles of colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer samples. We compared the classification performance of active learning with that of passive learning. The results showed that employing the active learning method can achieve high accuracy and significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances. For lung cancer classification, to achieve 96% of the total positives, only 31 labeled examples were needed in active learning whereas in passive learning 174 labeled examples were required. That meant over 82% reduction was realized by active learning. In active learning the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were over 0.81, while in passive learning the areas under the ROC curves were below 0.50.",2004,32,177,5,false,Computer Science,49421151,Y.

The labeled time-frequency images are then used to fine-tune the higher levels of the neural network architecture.

However, the reasons why volitional control might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the computational side, the development of efficient “active learning” algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging research topic in machine learning.

A Case Study on Android Malware Detection","To cope with the increasing variability and sophistication of modern attacks, machine learning has been widely adopted as a statistically-sound tool for malware detection. However, its security against well-crafted attacks has not only been recently questioned, but it has been shown that machine learning exhibits inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited to evade detection at test time. In other words, machine learning itself can be the weakest link in a security system. In this paper, we rely upon a previously-proposed attack framework to categorize potential attack scenarios against learning-based malware detection tools, by modeling attackers with different skills and capabilities. We then define and implement a set of corresponding evasion attacks to thoroughly assess the security of Drebin, an Android malware detector. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a simple and scalable secure-learning paradigm that mitigates the impact of evasion attacks, while only slightly worsening the detection rate in the absence of attack.

Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly owing to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gas samples' recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e., source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework called domain adaptation extreme learning machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gas recognition in E-nose systems, without losing the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called source DAELM (DAELM-S) and target DAELM (DAELM-T) are proposed in this paper. In order to perceive the differences among ELM, DAELM-S, and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected using E-nose system clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing drift-compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new perspectives for ELM.",2015,37,237,25,true,Engineering,36685537,Lei Zhang,66396175,D.

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters.

Most approaches, perhaps influenced by attribute weighting in other machine learning algorithms, use weighting to place more emphasis on highly predictive attributes than those that are less predictive. In this paper, we argue that for naive Bayes attribute weighting should instead be used to alleviate the conditional independence assumption. Based on this premise, we propose a weighted naive Bayes algorithm, called WANBIA, that selects weights to minimize either the negative conditional log likelihood or the mean squared error objective functions. We perform extensive evaluations and find that WANBIA is a competitive alternative to state of the art classifiers like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and A1DE.",2013,49,157,13,false,Mathematics,33899189,Nayyar Zaidi,1838956,J.

All rights reserved. Bayesian neural networks with latent variables are scalable and flexible probabilistic models: They account for uncertainty in the estimation of the network weights and, by making use of latent variables, can capture complex noise patterns in the : data. Using these models we show how to per- ∗ form and utilize a decomposition of uncertainty in • aleatoric and epistemic components for decision making purposes.

This has resulted in its practical use for either primary detection engines or supplementary heuristic detections by anti-malware vendors. Recent work in adversarial machine learning has shown that models are susceptible to gradient-based and other attacks. In this whitepaper, we summarize the various attacks that have been proposed for machine learning models in information security, each which require the adversary to have some degree of knowledge about the model under attack. Importantly, even when applied to attacking machine learning malware classifier based on static features for Windows portable executable (PE) files, these attacks, previous attack methodologies may break the format or functionality of the malware. We investigate a more general framework for attacking static PE anti-malware engines based on reinforcement learning, which models more realistic attacker conditions, and subsequently has provides much more modest evasion rates. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent is equipped with a set of functionality-preserving operations that it may perform on the PE file. It learns through a series of games played against the anti-malware engine which sequence of operations is most likely to result in evasion for a given malware sample. Given the general framework, it is not surprising that the evasion rates are modest. However, the resulting RL agent can succinctly summarize blind spots of the anti-malware model. Additionally, evasive variants generated by the agent may be used to harden machine learning anti-malware engine via adversarial training.",2017,25,111,10,false,,2639880,H.

Finding a heuristic that performs well on a broad range of applications is a tedious and difficult process. This paper introduces Meta Optimization, a methodology for automatically fine-tuning compiler heuristics. Meta Optimization uses machine-learning techniques to automatically search the space of compiler heuristics. Our techniques reduce compiler design complexity by relieving compiler writers of the tedium of heuristic tuning. Our machine-learning system uses an evolutionary algorithm to automatically find effective compiler heuristics. We present promising experimental results. In one mode of operation Meta Optimization creates application-specific heuristics which often result in impressive speedups. For hyperblock formation, one optimization we present in this paper, we obtain an average speedup of 23% (up to 73%) for the applications in our suite. Furthermore, by evolving a compiler's heuristic over several benchmarks, we can create effective, general-purpose heuristics. The best general-purpose heuristic our system found for hyperblock formation improved performance by an average of 25% on our training set, and 9% on a completely unrelated test set. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques on three different optimizations in this paper: hyperblock formation, register allocation, and data prefetching.",2003,25,306,20,false,Computer Science,1652011517,M.

However, imperfections in the training phase of deep neural networks make them vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted by adversaries with the intent of causing deep neural networks to misclassify. In this work, we formalize the space of adversaries against deep neural networks (DNNs) and introduce a novel class of algorithms to craft adversarial samples based on a precise understanding of the mapping between inputs and outputs of DNNs. In an application to computer vision, we show that our algorithms can reliably produce samples correctly classified by human subjects but misclassified in specific targets by a DNN with a 97% adversarial success rate while only modifying on average 4.02% of the input features per sample. We then evaluate the vulnerability of different sample classes to adversarial perturbations by defining a hardness measure. Finally, we describe preliminary work outlining defenses against adversarial samples by defining a predictive measure of distance between a benign input and a target classification.",2015,40,2879,398,true,Computer Science,1967156,Nicolas Papernot,144061974,P.

Rather, the growing amount of unlabeled data poses a big challenge to large-scale semi-supervised learning (SSL). We note that the computational intensiveness of graph-based SSL arises largely from the manifold or graph regularization, which in turn lead to large models that are difficult to handle. To alleviate this, we proposed the prototype vector machine (PVM), a highly scalable, graph-based algorithm for large-scale SSL. Our key innovation is the use of ""prototypes vectors"" for efficient approximation on both the graph-based regularizer and model representation. The choice of prototypes are grounded upon two important criteria: they not only perform effective low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix, but also span a model suffering the minimum information loss compared with the complete model. We demonstrate encouraging performance and appealing scaling properties of the PVM on a number of machine learning benchmark data sets.",2009,24,95,5,true,Computer Science,2152986588,Kai Zhang,145193332,J.

To address this, we adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation, for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based regularization PBR, where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk CVaR problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation SAA and PBR solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio. We find that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for two out of three Fama-French data sets.

Such models enable the prediction and discovery of sequences with optimal properties. Machine‐learning models generally require that their inputs be vectors, and the conversion from a protein sequence to a vector representation affects the model's ability to learn. We propose to learn embedded representations of protein sequences that take advantage of the vast quantity of unmeasured protein sequence data available. These embeddings are low‐dimensional and can greatly simplify downstream modeling. Results: The predictive power of Gaussian process models trained using embeddings is comparable to those trained on existing representations, which suggests that embeddings enable accurate predictions despite having orders of magnitude fewer dimensions. Moreover, embeddings are simpler to obtain because they do not require alignments, structural data, or selection of informative amino‐acid properties.

Two machine learning models are developed, namely, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the hybrid downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) models. These machine learning models are applied to a two-dimensional cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow problem, the machine-leaning-based super-resolution analysis can greatly enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data, holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent flows. With the growing availability of flow field data from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, the present approach motivates the development of effective super-resolution models for a variety of fluid flows.",2018,26,245,4,true,Physics,102460658,Kai Fukami,14873147,K.

Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by exploits, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. It is imperative to detect and act on such threats in a timely manner. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through the usage of blacklists. However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their own research and practical applications.

We develop a class of sequential generative models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation and image generation.

There are many reasons that users want systems to forget certain data including its lineage. From a privacy perspective, users who become concerned with new privacy risks of a system often want the system to forget their data and lineage. From a security perspective, if an attacker pollutes an anomaly detector by injecting manually crafted data into the training data set, the detector must forget the injected data to regain security. From a usability perspective, a user can remove noise and incorrect entries so that a recommendation engine gives useful recommendations. Therefore, we envision forgetting systems, capable of forgetting certain data and their lineages, completely and quickly. This paper focuses on making learning systems forget, the process of which we call machine unlearning, or simply unlearning. We present a general, efficient unlearning approach by transforming learning algorithms used by a system into a summation form. To forget a training data sample, our approach simply updates a small number of summations -- asymptotically faster than retraining from scratch. Our approach is general, because the summation form is from the statistical query learning in which many machine learning algorithms can be implemented. Our approach also applies to all stages of machine learning, including feature selection and modeling. Our evaluation, on four diverse learning systems and real-world workloads, shows that our approach is general, effective, fast, and easy to use.",2015,75,170,25,true,Computer Science,3139121,Yinzhi Cao,152211006,Junfeng Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.",2002,34,3000,253,false,Computer Science,145247053,W.

This passive learning is problematic if we are interested in developing interactive machines, such as conversational agents. We propose a framework for language learning that relies on multi-agent communication. We study this learning in the context of referential games. In these games, a sender and a receiver see a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target and is allowed to send a message from a fixed, arbitrary vocabulary to the receiver. The receiver must rely on this message to identify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively out of the need to communicate. We show that two networks with simple configurations are able to learn to coordinate in the referential game. We further explore how to make changes to the game environment to cause the ""word meanings"" induced in the game to better reflect intuitive semantic properties of the images. In addition, we present a simple strategy for grounding the agents' code into natural language.

A useful piece of information for scheduling jobs, typically not available, is the extent to which applications will use available resources once they are executed. This paper comparatively assesses the suitability of several machine learning techniques for predicting spatio temporal utilization of resources by applications. Modern machine learning techniques able to handle large number of attributes are used, taking into account application- and system-specific attributes (e.g., CPU micro architecture, size and speed of memory and storage, input data characteristics and input parameters). The work also extends an existing classification tree algorithm, called Predicting Query Runtime (PQR), to the regression problem by allowing the leaves of the tree to select the best regression method for each collection of data on leaves. The new method (PQR2) yields the best average percentage error, predicting execution time, memory and disk consumption for two bioinformatics applications, BLAST and RAxML, deployed on scenarios that differ in system and usage. In specific scenarios where usage is a non-linear function of system and application attributes, certain configurations of two other machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors, also yield competitive results. In addition, experiments show that the inclusion of system performance and application-specific attributes also improves the performance of machine learning algorithms investigated.",2010,25,179,6,false,Computer Science,1735571,Andréa M.

However, historical data also capture patterns of health care disparities, and machine-learning models trained on these data may perpetuate these inequities. This concern is not just academic. In a model used to predict future crime on the basis of historical arrest records, African American defendants who did not reoffend were classified as high risk at a substantially higher rate than white defendants who did not reoffend (2, 3). Similar biases have been observed in predictive policing (4) and identifying which calls to a child protective services agency required an in-person investigation (5, 6). The implications for health care led the American Medical Association to pass policy recommendations to promote development of thoughtfully designed, high-quality, clinically validated health care AI [artificial or augmented intelligence, such as machine learning] that . . . identifies and takes steps to address bias and avoids introducing or exacerbating health care disparities including when testing or deploying new AI tools on vulnerable populations (7). We argue that health care organizations and policymakers should go beyond the American Medical Association's position of doing no harm and instead proactively design and use machine-learning systems to advance health equity. Whereas much health disparities work has focused on discriminatory decision making and implicit biases by clinicians, policymakers, organizational leaders, and researchers are increasingly focusing on the ill health effects of structural racism and classismhow systems are shaped in ways that harm the health of disempowered, marginalized populations (8). For example, the United States has a shameful history of purposive decisions by government and private businesses to segregate housing. Zoning laws, discrimination in mortgage lending, prejudicial practices by real estate agents, and the ghettoization of public housing all contributed to the concentration of urban African Americans in inferior housing that has led to poor health (9, 10). Even when the goal of decision makers is not outright discrimination against disadvantaged groups, actions may lead to inequities. For example, if the goal of a machine-learning system is to maximize efficiency, that might come at the expense of disadvantaged populations. As a society, we value health equity. For example, the Healthy People 2020 vision statement aims for a society in which all people live long, healthy lives, and one of the mission's goals is to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups (11). The 4 classic principles of Western clinical medical ethics are justice, autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence. However, health equity will not be attained unless we purposely design our health and social systems, which increasingly will be infused with machine learning (12), to achieve this goal. To ensure fairness in machine learning, we recommend a participatory process that involves key stakeholders, including frequently marginalized populations, and considers distributive justice within specific clinical and organizational contexts. Different technical approaches can configure the mathematical properties of machine-learning models to render predictions that are equitable in various ways. The existence of mathematical levers must be supplemented with criteria for when and why they should be usedeach tool comes with tradeoffs that require ethical reasoning to decide what is best for a given application. We propose incorporating fairness into the design, deployment, and evaluation of machine-learning models. We discuss 2 clinical applications in which machine learning might harm protected groups by being inaccurate, diverting resources, or worsening outcomes, especially if the models are built without consideration for these patients. We then describe the mechanisms by which a model's design, data, and deployment may lead to disparities; explain how different approaches to distributive justice in machine learning can advance health equity; and explore what contexts are more appropriate for different equity approaches in machine learning. Case Study 1: Intensive Care Unit Monitoring A common area of predictive modeling research focuses on creating a monitoring systemfor example, to warn a rapid response team about inpatients at high risk for deterioration (1315), requiring their transfer to an intensive care unit within 6 hours. How might such a system inadvertently result in harm to a protected group? In this thought experiment, we consider African Americans as a protected group. To build the model, our hypothetical researchers collected historical records of patients who had clinical deterioration and those who did not. The model acts like a diagnostic test of risk for intensive care unit transfer. However, if too few African American patients were included in the training datathe data used to construct the modelthe model might be inaccurate for them. For example, it might have a lower sensitivity and miss more patients at risk for deterioration. African American patients might be harmed if clinical teams started relying on alerts to identify at-risk patients without realizing that the prediction system underdetects patients in that group (automation bias) (16). If the model had a lower positive predictive value for African Americans, it might also disproportionately harm them through dismissal biasa generalization of alert fatigue in which clinicians may learn to discount or dismiss alerts for African Americans because they are more likely to be false-positive (17). Case Study 2: Reducing Length of Stay Imagine that a hospital created a model with clinical and social variables to predict which inpatients might be discharged earliest so that it could direct limited case management resources to them to prevent delays. If residence in ZIP codes of socioeconomically depressed or predominantly African American neighborhoods predicted greater lengths of stay (18), this model might disproportionately allocate case management resources to patients from richer, predominantly white neighborhoods and away from African Americans in poorer ones. What Is Machine Learning? Traditionally, computer systems map inputs to outputs according to manually specified ifthen rules. With increasingly complex tasks, such as language translation, manually specifying rules becomes infeasible, and instead the mapping (or model) is learned by the system given only input examples represented through a set of features together with their desired output, referred to as labels. The quality of a model is assessed by computing evaluation metrics on data not used to build the model, such as sensitivity, specificity, or the c-statistic, which measures the ability of a model to distinguish patients with a condition from those without it (19, 20). Once the model's quality is deemed satisfactory, it can be deployed to make predictions on new examples for which the label is unknown when the prediction is made. The quality of the models on retrospective data must be followed with tests of clinical effectiveness, safety, and comparison with current practice, which may require clinical trials (21). Traditionally, statistical models for prediction, such as the pooled-cohort equation (22), have used few variables to predict clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular risk (23). Modern machine-learning techniques, however, can consider many more features. For example, a recent model to predict hospital readmissions examined hundreds of thousands of pieces of information, including the free text of clinical notes (24). Complex data and models can drive more personalized and accurate predictions but may also make algorithms hard to understand and trust (25). What Can Cause a Machine-Learning System to Be Unfair? The Glossary lists key biases in the design, data, and deployment of a machine-learning model that may perpetuate or exacerbate health care disparities if left unchecked. The Figure reveals how the various biases relate to one another and how the interactions of model predictions with clinicians and patients may exacerbate health care disparities. Biases may arise during the design of a model. For example, if the label is marred by health care disparities, such as predicting the onset of clinical depression in environments where protected groups have been systematically misdiagnosed, then the model will learn to perpetuate this disparity. This represents a generalization of test-referral bias (26) that we refer to as label bias. Moreover, the data on which the model is developed may be biased. Data on patients in the protected group might be distributed differently from those in the nonprotected group because of biological or nonbiological variation (9, 27). For example, the data may not contain enough examples from a group to properly tailor the predictions to them (minority bias) (28), or the data set of the protected group may be less informative because features are missing not at random as a result of more fragmented care (29, 30). Glossary Figure. Conceptual framework of how various biases relate to one another. During model development, differences in the distribution of features used to predict a label between the protected and nonprotected groups may bias a model to be less accurate for protected groups. Moreover, the data used to develop a model may not generalize to the data used during model deployment (trainingserving skew). Biases in model design and data affect patient outcomes through the model's interaction with clinicians and patients. The immediate effect of these differences is that the model may ",2018,52,296,12,true,Medicine,8638650,A. Rajkomar,40356669,Michaela Hardt,145310670,M. Howell,2084098271,Greg S. Corrado,2186184,M.

Traditional machine learning algorithms may be biased towards the majority class, thus producing poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. In this paper, we describe a new approach that combines boosting, an ensemble-based learning algorithm, with data generation to improve the predictive power of classifiers against imbalanced data sets consisting of two classes. In the DataBoost-IM method, hard examples from both the majority and minority classes are identified during execution of the boosting algorithm. Subsequently, the hard examples are used to separately generate synthetic examples for the majority and minority classes. The synthetic data are then added to the original training set, and the class distribution and the total weights of the different classes in the new training set are rebalanced. The DataBoost-IM method was evaluated, in terms of the F-measures, G-mean and overall accuracy, against seventeen highly and moderately imbalanced data sets using decision trees as base classifiers. Our results are promising and show that the DataBoost-IM method compares well in comparison with a base classifier, a standard benchmarking boosting algorithm and three advanced boosting-based algorithms for imbalanced data set. Results indicate that our approach does not sacrifice one class in favor of the other, but produces high predictions against both minority and majority classes.",2004,26,597,32,false,Computer Science,1694050,Hongyu Guo,1727256,H.

This wealth of data can help to learn models that can improve the user experience on each device. However, the scale and heterogeneity of federated data presents new challenges in research areas such as federated learning, meta-learning, and multi-task learning. As the machine learning community begins to tackle these challenges, we are at a critical time to ensure that developments made in these areas are grounded with realistic benchmarks. To this end, we propose LEAF, a modular benchmarking framework for learning in federated settings.

To describe and evaluate a machine learning-based, automated system to detect exudates and cotton-wool spots in digital color fundus photographs and differentiate them from drusen, for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.


METHODS
Three hundred retinal images from one eye of 300 patients with diabetes were selected from a diabetic retinopathy telediagnosis database (nonmydriatic camera, two-field photography): 100 with previously diagnosed bright lesions and 200 without. A machine learning computer program was developed that can identify and differentiate among drusen, (hard) exudates, and cotton-wool spots. A human expert standard for the 300 images was obtained by consensus annotation by two retinal specialists. Sensitivities and specificities of the annotations on the 300 images by the automated system and a third retinal specialist were determined.


RESULTS
The system achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.95 and sensitivity/specificity pairs of 0.95/0.88 for the detection of bright lesions of any type, and 0.95/0.86, 0.70/0.93, and 0.77/0.88 for the detection of exudates, cotton-wool spots, and drusen, respectively. The third retinal specialist achieved pairs of 0.95/0.74 for bright lesions and 0.90/0.98, 0.87/0.98, and 0.92/0.79 per lesion type.


CONCLUSIONS
A machine learning-based, automated system capable of detecting exudates and cotton-wool spots and differentiating them from drusen in color images obtained in community based diabetic patients has been developed and approaches the performance level of retinal experts. If the machine learning can be improved with additional training data sets, it may be useful for detecting clinically important bright lesions, enhancing early diagnosis, and reducing visual loss in patients with diabetes.",2007,29,400,9,true,Medicine,3142710,M.
