Social media is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters that are allowed in Twitter is 140. Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products.",2013,18,316,9,false,Computer Science,9388856,M. Neethu,144357907,R.

Learning methods are used in Dyna both for compiling planning results and for updating a model of the effects of the agent's actions on the world. Planning is incremental and can use the probabilistic and ofttimes incorrect world models generated by learning processes. Execution is fully reactive in the sense that no planning intervenes between perception and action. Dyna relies on machine learning methods for learning from examples---these are among the basic building blocks making up the architecture---yet is not tied to any particular method.

The Fast Local Kernel Support Vector Machine (FaLK-SVM) trains a set of local SVMs on redundant neighbourhoods in the training set and an appropriate model for each query point is selected at testing time according to a proximity strategy. Supported by a recent result by Zakai and Ritov (2009) relating consistency and localizability, our approach achieves high classification accuracies by dividing the separation function in local optimisation problems that can be handled very efficiently from the computational viewpoint. The introduction of a fast local model selection further speeds-up the learning process. Learning and complexity bounds are derived for FaLK-SVM, and the empirical evaluation of the approach (with data sets up to 3 million points) showed that it is much faster and more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art accurate and approximated SVM solvers at least for non high-dimensional data sets. More generally, we show that locality can be an important factor to sensibly speed-up learning approaches and kernel methods, differently from other recent techniques that tend to dismiss local information in order to improve scalability.",2010,84,93,5,false,Computer Science,47429813,N.

We compare (i) a newly developed algorithm (MOLFEA) for the generation of descriptors (molecular fragments) for noncongeneric compounds with traditional SAR approaches (molecular properties) and (ii) different machine learning algorithms for the induction of SARs from these descriptors. In addition we investigate the optimal parameter settings for these programs and give an exemplary interpretation of the derived models. The predictive accuracies of models using MOLFEA derived descriptors is approximately 10-15%age points higher than those using molecular properties alone. Using both types of descriptors together does not improve the derived models. From the applied machine learning techniques the rule learner PART and support vector machines gave the best results, although the differences between the learning algorithms are only marginal. We were able to achieve predictive accuracies up to 78% for 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting models are relatively easy to interpret and usable for predictive as well as for explanatory purposes.",2004,27,240,10,true,Computer Science,3323969,C.

We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.",2015,50,415,4,true,Physics,6781829,R.

Drug discovery, which is the process of discovering new candidate medications, is very important for pharmaceutical industries. At its current stage, discovering new drugs is still a very expensive and time-consuming process, requiring Phases I, II and III for clinical trials. Recently, machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the deep learning techniques which allow a computational model to generate multiple layers, have been widely applied and achieved state-of-the-art performance in different fields, such as speech recognition, image classification, bioinformatics, etc. One very important application of these AI techniques is in the field of drug discovery.


METHODS
We did a large-scale literature search on existing scientific websites (e.g, ScienceDirect, Arxiv) and startup companies to understand current status of machine learning techniques in drug discovery.


RESULTS
Our experiments demonstrated that there are different patterns in machine learning fields and drug discovery fields. For example, keywords like prediction, brain, discovery, and treatment are usually in drug discovery fields. Also, the total number of papers published in drug discovery fields with machine learning techniques is increasing every year.


CONCLUSION
The main focus of this survey is to understand the current status of machine learning techniques in the drug discovery field within both academic and industrial settings, and discuss its potential future applications. Several interesting patterns for machine learning techniques in drug discovery fields are discussed in this survey.",2019,74,126,0,false,Medicine,51183421,Natalie Stephenson,51204603,Emily Shane,2056317579,Jessica Chase,2066120681,Jason Rowland,Computer Science,2064613774,David Ries,2065880952,Nicola Justice,2159189616,Jie Zhang,145822563,Leong Chan,33082702,Renzhi Cao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While delivering impressive results across a range of computer vision and machine learning tasks, these networks are computationally demanding, limiting their deployability. Convolutional layers generally consume the bulk of the processing time, and so in this work we present two simple schemes for drastically speeding up these layers. This is achieved by exploiting cross-channel or filter redundancy to construct a low rank basis of filters that are rank-1 in the spatial domain. Our methods are architecture agnostic, and can be easily applied to existing CPU and GPU convolutional frameworks for tuneable speedup performance. We demonstrate this with a real world network designed for scene text character recognition [15], showing a possible 2.5× speedup with no loss in accuracy, and 4.5× speedup with less than 1% drop in accuracy, still achieving state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.",2014,42,1223,84,true,Computer Science,3093886,Max Jaderberg,1687524,A.

Yet such algorithms often exhibit undesirable behavior, from various types of bias to causing financial loss or delaying medical diagnoses. In standard machine learning approaches, the burden of avoiding this harmful behavior is placed on the user of the algorithm, who most often is not a computer scientist. Thomas et al. introduce a general framework for algorithm design in which this burden is shifted from the user to the designer of the algorithm. The researchers illustrate the benefits of their approach using examples in gender fairness and diabetes management. Science, this issue p. 999 A machine learning algorithm design framework shifts the burden of avoiding undesirable behavior from user to designer. Intelligent machines using machine learning algorithms are ubiquitous, ranging from simple data analysis and pattern recognition tools to complex systems that achieve superhuman performance on various tasks. Ensuring that they do not exhibit undesirable behavior—that they do not, for example, cause harm to humans—is therefore a pressing problem. We propose a general and flexible framework for designing machine learning algorithms. This framework simplifies the problem of specifying and regulating undesirable behavior. To show the viability of this framework, we used it to create machine learning algorithms that precluded the dangerous behavior caused by standard machine learning algorithms in our experiments. Our framework for designing machine learning algorithms simplifies the safe and responsible application of machine learning.",2019,209,101,4,false,Medicine,143640165,P.

PBG uses graph partitioning to train arbitrarily large embeddings on either a single machine or in a distributed environment.

However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01–0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose a highly scalable and hybrid DNNs framework called scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet which can be used in real-time to effectively monitor the network traffic and host-level events to proactively alert possible cyberattacks.",2019,85,546,24,true,Computer Science,51162051,R.

Bayesian methods provide a general framework to quantify uncertainty. However, because of model misspecification and the use of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate -- for example, a 90% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90% of the time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm; when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling and extends previous work on classification. We evaluate this approach on Bayesian linear regression, feedforward, and recurrent neural networks, and find that it consistently outputs well-calibrated credible intervals while improving performance on time series forecasting and model-based reinforcement learning tasks.",2018,34,349,51,false,Computer Science,145712106,Volodymyr Kuleshov,51130926,Nathan Fenner,2490652,S.

This study describes two machine learning techniques applied to predict liquefaction susceptibility of soil based on the standard penetration test (SPT) data from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. The first machine learning technique which uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on multi-layer perceptions (MLP) that are trained with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The second machine learning technique uses the Support Vector machine (SVM) that is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning theory, uses classification technique. ANN and SVM have been developed to predict liquefaction susceptibility using corrected SPT [(N1)60] and cyclic stress ratio (CSR). Further, an attempt has been made to simplify the models, requiring only the two parameters [(N1)60 and peck ground acceleration (amax/g)], for the prediction of liquefaction susceptibility. The developed ANN and SVM models have also been applied to different case histories available globally. The paper also highlights the capability of the SVM over the ANN models.",2011,41,138,13,true,Engineering,3258641,P. Samui,145447732,T.

This challenge comprised 12,000 environmental chemicals and drugs which were measured for 12 different toxic effects by specifically designed assays. We participated in this challenge to assess the performance of Deep Learning in computational toxicity prediction. Deep Learning has already revolutionized image processing, speech recognition, and language understanding but has not yet been applied to computational toxicity. Deep Learning is founded on novel algorithms and architectures for artificial neural networks together with the recent availability of very fast computers and massive datasets. It discovers multiple levels of distributed representations of the input, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. We hypothesized that the construction of a hierarchy of chemical features gives Deep Learning the edge over other toxicity prediction methods. Furthermore, Deep Learning naturally enables multi-task learning, that is, learning of all toxic effects in one neural network and thereby learning of highly informative chemical features. In order to utilize Deep Learning for toxicity prediction, we have developed the DeepTox pipeline. First, DeepTox normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds. Then it computes a large number of chemical descriptors that are used as input to machine learning methods. In its next step, DeepTox trains models, evaluates them, and combines the best of them to ensembles. Finally, DeepTox predicts the toxicity of new compounds. In the Tox21 Data Challenge, DeepTox had the highest performance of all computational methods winning the grand challenge, the nuclear receptor panel, the stress response panel, and six single assays (teams ``Bioinf@JKU'').

Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. 
The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting ""general purpose"" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. 
An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. 
The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by learning perturbation sets from data, in order to characterize real-world effects for robust training and evaluation. Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set over a constrained region of the latent space. We formulate desirable properties that measure the quality of a learned perturbation set, and theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a variety of perturbations at different complexities and scales, ranging from baseline spatial transformations, through common image corruptions, to lighting variations. We measure the quality of our learned perturbation sets both quantitatively and qualitatively, finding that our models are capable of producing a diverse set of meaningful perturbations beyond the limited data seen during training. Finally, we leverage our learned perturbation sets to train models which are empirically and certifiably robust to adversarial image corruptions and adversarial lighting variations, while improving generalization on non-adversarial data.

In this paper, I address this by exploring a politics of learning through two key sites: first, tactical learning; second, urban learning forums. I offer a conception of learning based on three processes: translation , or the relational distributions through which learning is produced as a sociomaterial epistemology of displacement and change; coordination , or the construction of functional systems that enable learning as a means of linking different forms of knowledge, coping with complexity and facilitating adaptation; and dwelling , or the education of attention through which learning operates as a way of seeing and inhabiting the world. I then consider this conception of learning in relation to tactical learning, i.e. the resources marginal groups use to cope with, negotiate and resist in the city, and urban learning forums, i.e. the possibilities for progressive forms of learning between different constituencies in the city.

We also include a comparative study of the genetics-based machine learning (GBML) methods with some classical non-evolutionary algorithms, in order to observe the suitability and high potential of the search performed by evolutionary algorithms and the behavior of the GBML algorithms in contrast to the classical approaches, in terms of classification accuracy.",2010,111,147,13,false,Computer Science,143741583,Alberto Fernández,39558258,S.

The security of Asirra is based on the presumed difficulty of classifying these images automatically. In this paper, we describe a classifier which is 82.7% accurate in telling apart the images of cats and dogs used in Asirra. This classifier is a combination of support-vector machine classifiers trained on color and texture features extracted from images. Our classifier allows us to solve a 12-image Asirra challenge automatically with probability 10.3%. This probability of success is significantly higher than the estimate of 0.2% given in [7] for machine vision attacks. Our results suggest caution against deploying Asirra without safeguards. We also investigate the impact of our attacks on the partial credit and token bucket algorithms proposed in [7]. The partial credit algorithm weakens Asirra considerably and we recommend against its use. The token bucket algorithm helps mitigate the impact of our attacks and allows Asirra to be deployed in a way that maintains an appealing balance between usability and security. One contribution of our work is to inform the choice of safeguard parameters in Asirra deployments.",2009,22,231,23,true,Computer Science,2779068,P.

In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.",2017,67,1526,78,true,Computer Science,1730754,Jiawei Su,145197293,Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas,145106127,K.

We apply these results to the problem of auctioning a digital good, the attribute auction problem, and to the problem of item-pricing in unlimited-supply combinatorial auctions. From a learning perspective, these settings present several challenges: in particular the loss function is discontinuous and asymmetric, and the range of bidders' valuations may be large.",2005,35,123,8,false,Computer Science,1745410,Maria-Florina Balcan,1690967,A.

Even though the learning ability and computational complexity of training in support vector machines may be independent of the dimension of the feature space, reducing computational complexity is an essential issue to efficiently handle a large number of terms in practical applications of text classification. In this paper, we adopt novel dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimension of the document vectors dramatically. We also introduce decision functions for the centroid-based classification algorithm and support vector classifiers to handle the classification problem where a document may belong to multiple classes.

Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are a biologically-inspired trainable architecture that can learn invariant features. Each stage in a ConvNets is composed of a filter bank, some nonlinearities, and feature pooling layers. With multiple stages, a ConvNet can learn multi-level hierarchies of features. While ConvNets have been successfully deployed in many commercial applications from OCR to video surveillance, they require large amounts of labeled training samples.

Thus it seems hard to reconcile these competing interests. However, they frequently must be balanced when mining sensitive data. For example, medical research represents an important application where it is necessary both to extract useful information and protect patient privacy. One way to resolve the conflict is to extract general characteristics of whole populations without disclosing the private information of individuals. 
In this paper, we consider differential privacy, one of the most popular and powerful definitions of privacy. We explore the interplay between machine learning and differential privacy, namely privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms and learning-based data release mechanisms. We also describe some theoretical results that address what can be learned differentially privately and upper bounds of loss functions for differentially private algorithms. 
Finally, we present some open questions, including how to incorporate public data, how to deal with missing data in private datasets, and whether, as the number of observed samples grows arbitrarily large, differentially private machine learning algorithms can be achieved at no cost to utility as compared to corresponding non-differentially private algorithms.",2014,65,186,6,false,Computer Science,40387717,Zhanglong Ji,32219137,Zachary Chase Lipton,1722831,C.

Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14% improvement based on the standard F1 score.",2018,34,787,148,false,Computer Science,2991105,Bo Zong,2091568319,Qi Song,2984407,Martin Renqiang Min,92186360,Wei Cheng,,2470254,C.

Machine learning can be applied to MS-derived proteomics data in two ways. First, directly to mass spectral peaks and second, to proteins identified by sequence database searching, although relative protein quantification is required for the latter. Machine learning has been applied to mass spectrometry data from different biological disciplines, particularly for various cancers. The aims of such investigations have been to identify biomarkers and to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of specific diseases. This review describes how machine learning has been applied to proteomics tandem mass spectrometry data. This includes how it can be used to identify proteins suitable for use as biomarkers of disease and for classification of samples into disease or treatment groups, which may be applicable for diagnostics.

What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of resubmission. 
 
In this work, we introduce a notion of leaderboard accuracy tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called the Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from an actual competition hosted by Kaggle. 
 
Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy.

This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns. 1 Machine Learning and Complex Systems Real world software engineers are often faced with the challenge of moving quickly to ship new products or services, which can lead to a dilemma between speed of execution and quality of engineering. The concept of technical debt was first introduced by Ward Cunningham in 1992 as a way to help quantify the cost of such decisions. Like incurring fiscal debt, there are often sound strategic reasons to take on technical debt. Not all debt is necessarily bad, but technical debt does tend to compound. Deferring the work to pay it off results in increasing costs, system brittleness, and reduced rates of innovation. Traditional methods of paying off technical debt include refactoring, increasing coverage of unit tests, deleting dead code, reducing dependencies, tightening APIs, and improving documentation [4]. The goal of these activities is not to add new functionality, but to make it easier to add future improvements, be cheaper to maintain, and reduce the likelihood of bugs. One of the basic arguments in this paper is that machine learning packages have all the basic code complexity issues as normal code, but also have a larger system-level complexity that can create hidden debt. Thus, refactoring these libraries, adding better unit tests, and associated activity is time well spent but does not necessarily address debt at a systems level. In this paper, we focus on the system-level interaction between machine learning code and larger systems as an area where hidden technical debt may rapidly accumulate. At a system-level, a machine learning model may subtly erode abstraction boundaries. It may be tempting to re-use input signals in ways that create unintended tight coupling of otherwise disjoint systems. Machine learning packages may often be treated as black boxes, resulting in large masses of “glue code” or calibration layers that can lock in assumptions. Changes in the external world may make models or input signals change behavior in unintended ways, ratcheting up maintenance cost and the burden of any debt. Even monitoring that the system as a whole is operating as intended may be difficult without careful design.",2014,10,260,10,false,Business,1733143,D. Sculley,144510728,Gary Holt,145973657,D.

Machine learning techniques and humans have skills that complement each other — machine learning techniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of granularity, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their experience, and transferring the knowledge across domains. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning that enables people to interact effectively with machine learning models to make better decisions, without requiring in-depth knowledge about machine learning techniques. Many of us interact with machine learning systems everyday. Systems that mine data for product recommendations, for example, are ubiquitous. However these systems compute their output without end-user involvement, and there are typically no life or death consequences in the case the machine learning result is not acceptable to the user. In contrast, domains where decisions can have serious consequences (e.g., emergency response panning, medical decision-making), require the incorporation of human experts’ domain knowledge. These systems also must be transparent to earn experts’ trust and be adopted in their workflow. The challenge addressed in this thesis is that traditional machine learning systems are not designed to extract domain experts’ knowledge from natural workflow, or to provide pathways for the human domain expert to directly interact with the algorithm to interject their knowledge or to better understand the system output. For machine learning systems to make a real-world impact in these important domains, these systems must be able to communicate with highly skilled human experts to leverage their judgment and expertise, and share useful information or patterns from the data. In this thesis, I bridge this gap by building human-in-the-loop machine learning models and systems that compute and communicate machine learning results in ways that are compatible with the human decision-making process, and that can readily incorporate human experts’ domain knowledge. I start by building a machine learning model that infers human teams’ planning decisions from the structured form of natural language of team meetings. I show that the model can infer a human teams’ final plan with 86% accuracy",2015,135,83,6,false,Engineering,3351164,Been Kim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Towards Understanding the Effectiveness of MAML,"An important research direction in machine learning has centered around developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning. An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks. Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse, with the meta initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of a MAML-trained network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.",2019,42,357,85,false,Computer Science,31411877,Aniruddh Raghu,40297238,M.

Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi-supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efficiently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n3) to O(kn2), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be significantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets.

The goal is to reduce the recirculation zone of backward-facing step flow at $\mathit{Re}_{h}=1350$ manipulated by a slotted jet and optically sensed by online particle image velocimetry. The feedback control law is optimized with respect to a cost functional based on the recirculation area and a penalization of the actuation. This optimization is performed employing genetic programming. After 12 generations comprised of 500 individuals, the algorithm converges to a feedback law which reduces the recirculation zone by 80 %. This machine learning control is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing which excites Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices. The machine learning control yields a new actuation mechanism resonating with the low-frequency flapping mode instability. This feedback control performs similarly to periodic forcing at the design condition but outperforms periodic forcing when the Reynolds number is varied by a factor two. The current study indicates that machine learning control can effectively explore and optimize new feedback actuation mechanisms in numerous experimental applications.",2014,57,162,1,true,Physics,144932679,N.

Conventionally, metabolomics data analysis for diagnosis is done using various statistical and machine learning based classification methods. However, it remains unknown if deep neural network, a class of increasingly popular machine learning methods, is suitable to classify metabolomics data. Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+) and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-), to test the accuracies of autoencoder, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), and Generalized Boosted Models (GBM). DL framework has the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER-patients, compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways (adjusted P-value<0.05) that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them, protein digestion & absorption and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary, deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification, with both the highest prediction accurcy (AUC=0.93) and better revelation of disease biology. We encourage the adoption of autoencoder based deep learning method in the metabolomics research community for classification.",2017,85,141,7,true,Biology,2083360167,F.

We introduce a unifying framework for many conditional average treatment effect estimators, and we propose a metalearner, the X-learner, which can adapt to structural properties, such as the smoothness and sparsity of the underlying treatment effect. We present its favorable properties, using theory and simulations. We apply it, using random forests, to two field experiments in political science, where it is shown to be easy to use and to produce results that are interpretable. There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.",2017,41,365,68,true,Medicine,49962158,Sören R. Künzel,7359134,J. Sekhon,1678771,P.

Following these models, a ternary rhenium tungsten carbide and a quaternary molybdenum tungsten borocarbide are selected and synthesized at ambient pressure.

These hybrid classifiers enable fast prototyping of machine learning models that can improve on both algorithm performance and human judgment, and accomplish tasks where automated feature extraction is not yet feasible. Flock, an interactive machine learning platform, instantiates this approach. To generate informative features, Flock asks the crowd to compare paired examples, an approach inspired by analogical encoding. The crowd's efforts can be focused on specific subsets of the input space where machine-extracted features are not predictive, or instead used to partition the input space and improve algorithm performance in subregions of the space. An evaluation on six prediction tasks, ranging from detecting deception to differentiating impressionist artists, demonstrated that aggregating crowd features improves upon both asking the crowd for a direct prediction and off-the-shelf machine learning features by over 10%.

Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms.

A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actually prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a simple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to capture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by decoupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.",2008,39,494,90,false,Computer Science,39799304,J.

However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize to new data points. In this paper, we study the connections between metric learning and kernel learning that arise when studying metric learning as a linear transformation learning problem. In particular, we propose a general optimization framework for learning metrics via linear transformations, and analyze in detail a special case of our framework-that of minimizing the LogDet divergence subject to linear constraints. We then propose a general regularized framework for learning a kernel matrix, and show it to be equivalent to our metric learning framework. Our theoretical connections between metric and kernel learning have two main consequences: 1) the learned kernel matrix parameterizes a linear transformation kernel function and can be applied inductively to new data points, 2) our result yields a constructive method for kernelizing most existing Mahalanobis metric learning formulations.

In our method, each fuzzy if-then rule is handled as an individual, and a fitness value is assigned to each rule. Thus, our method can be viewed as a classifier system. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy if-then rules and fuzzy reasoning for pattern classification problems. Then we explain a genetics-based machine learning method that automatically generates fuzzy if-then rules for pattern classification problems from numerical data. Because our method uses linguistic values with fixed membership functions as antecedent fuzzy sets, a linguistic interpretation of each fuzzy if-then rule is easily obtained. The fixed membership functions also lead to a simple implementation of our method as a computer program. The simplicity of implementation and the linguistic interpretation of the generated fuzzy if-then rules are the main characteristic features of our method. The performance of our method is evaluated by computer simulations on some well-known test problems. While our method involves no tuning mechanism of membership functions, it works very well in comparison with other classification methods such as nonfuzzy machine learning techniques and neural networks.",1999,66,502,37,true,Computer Science,10022373,H.
