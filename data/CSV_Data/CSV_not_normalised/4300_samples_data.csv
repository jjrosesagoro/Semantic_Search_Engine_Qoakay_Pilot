The study of genres as bodies of musical items aggregated according to subjective and local criteria requires corresponding inductive models of such a notion. This process can be thus modeled as an example-driven learning task. We investigated the impact of different musical features on the inductive accuracy by first creating a medium-sized collection of examples for widely recognized genres and then evaluating the performances of different learning algorithms. In this work, features are derived from the MIDI transcriptions of the song collection.",2004,15,82,7,false,Computer Science,,144654543,Roberto Basili,28868488,Alfredo Serafini,1763333,A.

Some algorithms can be slowed or their performance irrelevant or redundant to the learning task. Feature subset selection, then, is a method for enhancing the performance of learning algorithms, reducing the hypothesis search space, and, in some cases, reducing the storage requirement. This paper describes a feature subset selector that uses a correlation based evaluates its effectiveness with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based learner (IB1).

This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users’ behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical tools, machine learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing, and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey relevant literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial on ML for researchers and practitioners interested in this field. Although a good number of research papers have recently appeared, the application of ML to optical networks is still in its infancy: to stimulate further work in this area, we conclude this paper proposing new possible research directions.",2018,127,317,12,true,Computer Science,Mathematics,48419853,F.

We consider gradual domain adaptation, where the goal is to adapt an initial classifier trained on a source domain given only unlabeled data that shifts gradually in distribution towards a target domain. We prove the first non-vacuous upper bound on the error of self-training with gradual shifts, under settings where directly adapting to the target domain can result in unbounded error. The theoretical analysis leads to algorithmic insights, highlighting that regularization and label sharpening are essential even when we have infinite data, and suggesting that self-training works particularly well for shifts with small Wasserstein-infinity distance. Leveraging the gradual shift structure leads to higher accuracies on a rotating MNIST dataset and a realistic Portraits dataset.",2020,50,98,23,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,32423266,Ananya Kumar,1901958,Tengyu Ma,145419642,Percy Liang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that shared memory multiprocessors can successfully utilize machine learning algorithms for memory access pattern prediction. In particular three different on-line machine learning prediction techniques were tested to learn and predict repetitive memory access patterns for three typical parallel processing applications, the 2-D relaxation algorithm, matrix multiply and Fast Fourier Transform on a shared memory multiprocessor. The predictions were then used by a routing control algorithm to reduce control latency in the interconnection network by configuring the interconnection network to provide needed memory access paths before they were requested.

The availability of an automated computer analysis tool that is more objective than human readers can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. A computer‐assisted classification method combining conventional MRI and perfusion MRI is developed and used for differential diagnosis. The proposed scheme consists of several steps including region‐of‐interest definition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The extracted features include tumor shape and intensity characteristics, as well as rotation invariant texture features. Feature subset selection is performed using support vector machines with recursive feature elimination. The method was applied on a population of 102 brain tumors histologically diagnosed as metastasis ( 24 ), meningiomas ( 4 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade II ( 22 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade III ( 18 ), and glioblastomas ( 34 ). The binary support vector machine classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, assessed by leave‐one‐out cross‐validation, were, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 79% for discrimination of metastases from gliomas and 88%, 85%, and 96% for discrimination of high‐grade (grades III and IV) from low‐grade (grade II) neoplasms. Multiclass classification was also performed via a one‐vs‐all voting scheme. Magn Reson Med, 2009. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",2009,48,630,34,true,Computer Science,Medicine,1784303,E.

In this paper, we propose deep learning as a natural source for obtaining additional, complementary representations. To learn features in high-resolution images, we make use of convolutional deep belief networks. Moreover, to take advantage of global structure in an object class, we develop local convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines, a novel convolutional learning model that exploits the global structure by not assuming stationarity of features across the image, while maintaining scalability and robustness to small misalignments. We also present a novel application of deep learning to descriptors other than pixel intensity values, such as LBP. In addition, we compare performance of networks trained using unsupervised learning against networks with random filters, and empirically show that learning weights not only is necessary for obtaining good multilayer representations, but also provides robustness to the choice of the network architecture parameters. Finally, we show that a recognition system using only representations obtained from deep learning can achieve comparable accuracy with a system using a combination of hand-crafted image descriptors. Moreover, by combining these representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-world face verification database.",2012,45,401,22,true,Computer Science,,3219900,Gary B.

In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at test time task identity is provided and--in case it is not--whether it must be inferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of how efficient different methods are. In particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental learning), we find that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences seems required for solving this scenario.",2019,36,348,30,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,118439707,Gido M. van de Ven,1739838,A.

To this end, there have been many attempts at learning a representation well-suited for novelty detection and designing a score based on such representation. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method named contrasting shifted instances (CSI), inspired by the recent success on contrastive learning of visual representations. Specifically, in addition to contrasting a given sample with other instances as in conventional contrastive learning methods, our training scheme contrasts the sample with distributionally-shifted augmentations of itself. Based on this, we propose a new detection score that is specific to the proposed training scheme. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method under various novelty detection scenarios, including unlabeled one-class, unlabeled multi-class and labeled multi-class settings, with various image benchmark datasets.",2020,87,231,65,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,1750599181,Jihoon Tack,9962692,Sangwoo Mo,83125078,Jongheon Jeong,143720148,Jinwoo Shin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For two vertices u and v, the hitting time Huv is the expected time it takes a random walk to travel from u to v. The commute distance is its symmetrized version Cuv = Huv +Hvu. In our paper we study the behavior of hitting times and commute distances when the number n of vertices in the graph tends to infinity. We focus on random geometric graphs (e-graphs, kNN graphs and Gaussian similarity graphs), but our results also extend to graphs with a given expected degree distribution or Erdos-Renyi graphs with planted partitions. We prove that in these graph families, the suitably rescaled hitting time Huv converges to 1/dv and the rescaled commute time to 1/du+1=dv where du and dv denote the degrees of vertices u and v. In these cases, hitting and commute times do not provide information about the structure of the graph, and their use is discouraged in many machine learning applications.",2014,74,99,16,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,1728654,U.

Offline system development and application,"Although fuzzy logic controllers and expert systems have been successfully applied in many complex industrial processes, they experience a deficiency in knowledge acquisition and rely to a great extent on empirical and heuristic knowledge which, in many cases, cannot be objectively elicited. Among the problems to be resolved in fuzzy controller design are the determination of the linguistic state space, definition of the membership functions of each linguistic term and the derivation of the control rules. Some of these problems can be solved by application of machine learning. First, it is desirable to simplify and automate the specification of linguistic rules. Secondly, it is also desirable that modification of control rules is possible in order to cope with previously unknown or changes in process dynamics. Machine learning methods have, in recent years, emerged from the use of learning algorithms modelled on natural and biological systems. These methods attempt to abstract the advanced mechanisms of learning exhibited by such systems, which can consequently be applied to intelligent control. One of these new algorithms is the genetic algorithm which is modelled on the processes of natural evolution. The paper develops the application of genetic algorithm techniques for fuzzy controller design. Genetic algorithms are used to automate and introduce objective criteria in defining fuzzy controller parameters.",1995,0,199,2,false,Computer Science,,20513909,D. Linkens,1903882,H.

Early approaches to this goal during the heydays of artificial intelligence research in the late 1980s, however, made it clear that an approach purely based on reasoning or human insights would not be able to model all the perceptuomotor tasks of future robots. Instead, new hope was put in the growing wake of machine learning that promised fully adaptive control algorithms which learn both by observation and trial-and-error. However, to date, learning techniques have yet to fulfill this promise as only few methods manage to scale into the high-dimensional domains of manipulator and humanoid robotics and usually scaling was only achieved in precisely pre-structured domains. We have investigated the ingredients for a general approach to motor skill learning in order to get one step closer towards human-like performance. For doing so, we study two major components for such an approach, i.e., firstly, a theoretically well-founded general approach to representing the required control structures for task representation and execution and, secondly, appropriate learning algorithms which can be applied in this setting.",2008,217,68,6,false,Computer Science,,145197867,Jan Peters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we try to provide some theoretical understanding of this approach. Our main result is to expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold regularization methods are helpful. We show that for such problems, no supervised learner can learn effectively. On the other hand, a manifold based learner (that knows the manifold or ""learns"" it from unlabeled examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. Our analysis follows a minimax style with an emphasis on finite sample results (in terms of n: the number of labeled examples). These results allow us to properly interpret manifold regularization and related spectral and geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised learning.",2013,32,101,8,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,1770745,P.

In this regard, unsupervised (e.g., K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)) and supervised (e.g., support vector machine (SVM) and weighted K-nearest-neighbor (KNN)) learning-based classification techniques are implemented for CSS. For a radio channel, the vector of the energy levels estimated at CR devices is treated as a feature vector and fed into a classifier to decide whether the channel is available or not. The classifier categorizes each feature vector into either of the two classes, namely, the ""channel available class"" and the ""channel unavailable class"". Prior to the online classification, the classifier needs to go through a training phase. For classification, the K-means clustering algorithm partitions the training feature vectors into K clusters, where each cluster corresponds to a combined state of primary users (PUs) and then the classifier determines the class the test energy vector belongs to. The GMM obtains a mixture of Gaussian density functions that well describes the training feature vectors. In the case of the SVM, the support vectors (i.e., a subset of training vectors which fully specify the decision function) are obtained by maximizing the margin between the separating hyperplane and the training feature vectors. Furthermore, the weighted KNN classification technique is proposed for CSS for which the weight of each feature vector is calculated by evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of that feature vector. The performance of each classification technique is quantified in terms of the average training time, the sample classification delay, and the ROC curve. Our comparative results clearly reveal that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing state-of-the-art CSS techniques.",2013,23,292,30,false,Computer Science,,1757321,K. Thilina,34647273,K.

However, its usage in communications systems has not been well explored. This paper investigates the use of the DL in modulation classification, which is a major task in many communications systems. The DL relies on a massive amount of data and, for research and applications, this can be easily available in communications systems. Furthermore, unlike the ML, the DL has the advantage of not requiring manual feature selections, which significantly reduces the task complexity in modulation classification. In this paper, we use two convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models, AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Specifically, we develop several methods to represent modulated signals in data formats with gridlike topologies for the CNN. The impacts of representation on classification performance are also analyzed. In addition, comparisons with traditional cumulant and ML-based algorithms are presented.

A statistical learning machine tries to infer rules from a given set of examples such that it is able to make correct predictions on unseen examples. These predictions can for example be a classification or a regression. We consider the class of kernel based learning techniques. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. Building upon the theory of reproducing kernels we propose a number of new learning algorithms based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient in a kernel feature space. We exemplify this for oriented (kernel) PCA, and especially for Fisher’s discriminant, yielding kernel Fisher discriminants (KFD). Furthermore, we show that KFD is intimately related to quadratic and linear optimization. Building upon this connection we propose several ways to deal with the optimization problems arising in kernel based methods and especially for KFD. This mathematical programming formulation is the starting point to derive several important and interesting variants of KFD, namely robust KFD, sparse KFD and linear KFD. Several algorithms to solve the resulting optimization problems are discussed. As a last consequence of the mathematical programming formulation we are able to relate KFD to other techniques like support vector machines, relevance vector machines and Arc-GV. Through a structural comparison of the underlying optimization problems we illustrate that many modern learning techniques, including KFD, are highly similar. In a separate chapter we present first results dealing with learning guarantees for eigenvalues and eigenvectors estimated from covariance matrices. We show that under some mild assumptions empirical eigenvalues are with high probability close to the expected eigenvalues when training on a specific, finite sample size. For eigenvectors we show that also with high probability an empirical eigenvector will be close to an eigenvector of the underlying distribution. In a large collection of experiments we demonstrate that KFD and its variants proposed here are capable of producing state of the art results. We compare KFD to techniques like AdaBoost and support vector machines, carefully discussing its advantages and also its difficulties.",2003,165,156,17,false,Computer Science,,2459012,S.

Scoring functions (SFs) are employed to rank these molecules by their predicted binding affinity (potency). A classical SF assumes a predetermined theory‐inspired functional form for the relationship between the features characterizing the structure of the protein–ligand complex and its predicted binding affinity (this relationship is almost always assumed to be linear). Recent years have seen the prosperity of machine‐learning SFs, which are fast regression models built instead with contemporary supervised learning algorithms. In this review, we analyzed machine‐learning SFs for drug lead optimization in the 2015–2019 period. The performance gap between classical and machine‐learning SFs was large and has now broadened owing to methodological improvements and the availability of more training data. Against the expectations of many experts, SFs employing deep learning techniques were not always more predictive than those based on more established machine learning techniques and, when they were, the performance gain was small. More codes and webservers are available and ready to be applied to prospective structure‐based drug lead optimization studies. These have exhibited excellent predictive accuracy in compelling retrospective tests, outperforming in some cases much more computationally demanding molecular simulation‐based methods.

I argue, however, that opaque decisions are more common in medicine than critics realize.

In this paper, we present a greedy layer-wise learning algorithm for Deep Mixtures of Factor Analysers (DMFAs). Even though a DMFA can be converted to an equivalent shallow MFA by multiplying together the factor loading matrices at different levels, learning and inference are much more efficient in a DMFA and the sharing of each lower-level factor loading matrix by many different higher level MFAs prevents overfitting.

In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets. InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively. The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs. Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands.",2018,50,248,19,true,Computer Science,Geology,1961067,M.

However, this communication protocol can be adopted by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks for different nodes, which has been shown as a big threat to most machine learning models. Therefore, we in this article intend to study the model vulnerability of federated machine learning, and even on IoT systems. To be specific, we here attempt to attacking a popular federated multitask learning framework, which uses a general multitask learning framework to handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. The problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask learning is formulated as a bilevel program, which is adaptive to the arbitrary selection of target nodes and source attacking nodes. We then propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, called as attack on federated learning (AT2FL), to efficiently derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. This is an earlier work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via data poisoning. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both poisoning attacks.",2020,21,46,3,true,Computer Science,,7332901,Gan Sun,145702758,Yang Cong,46436215,Jiahua Dong,2153018830,Qiang Wang,40478933,Ji Liu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This learning mechanism significantly challenges the attack from the server side. Although the state-of-the-art attacking techniques that incorporated the advance of Generative adversarial networks (GANs) could construct class representatives of the global data distribution among all clients, it is still challenging to distinguishably attack a specific client (i.e., user-level privacy leakage), which is a stronger privacy threat to precisely recover the private data from a specific client. This paper gives the first attempt to explore user-level privacy leakage against the federated learning by the attack from a malicious server. We propose a framework incorporating GAN with a multi-task discriminator, which simultaneously discriminates category, reality, and client identity of input samples. The novel discrimination on client identity enables the generator to recover user specified private data. Unlike existing works that tend to interfere the training process of the federated learning, the proposed method works “invisibly” on the server side.

Feedback is needed to change these behaviours. For this feedback, first accurate monitoring is needed: sedentary behaviour must be classified as well as the intensity of physical activity. 
In this report a State of the Art analysis is performed to compare different classification techniques and finally two methods, both using an accelerometer on the waist, are worked out. These methods are Integral of the Modulus of the Accelerometer (IMA) classification and a machine learning technique (MLT): support vector machine (SVM). These methods are then applied in a laboratory experiment to study their quality. A measurement setup is made to create a dataset of the following activities: standing, sitting, lying, walking (2.4 - 7.5 km/h) and cycling (10.1-19 km/h). This dataset (n=15) is analysed and classified using Matlab for both methods. 
The IMA method was unable to monitor sedentary behaviour, but could classify the physical activity (PA) intensity with an accuracy of 66%. The SVM method within subjects was able to monitor sedentary behaviour with an accuracy of 91±20% and the classification of the PA intensity has an accuracy of 94±5%. For between subjects the accuracies decrease to 71±13% for PA intensity accuracy and 45±35% for the sedentary behaviour classification. 
IMA was implemented in the old feedback system, monitoring the overall daily amount of physical activity, but can significantly be outperformed by replacing it with the current SVM implementation. At this moment however, SVM can only be used to improve the old system, it cannot yet be used to create new additions to the feedback system, such as the implementation of the feedback of the sedentary behaviour and specific physical activity intensities. New methods and properties of the current SVM system have been found that might increase the accuracies of the between subject analysis and therefore might enable SVM to become applicable for the extra feedback options.",2015,12,2706,138,false,Engineering,,1581793152,D.

The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements.

A general principle to tackle this problem is reducing the distribution difference between training data and testing data such that the generalization error can be bounded. Current methods typically model the sample distributions in input feature space, which depends on nonlinear feature mapping to embody the distribution discrepancy. However, this nonlinear feature space may not be optimal for the kernel-based learning machines. To this end, we propose a transfer kernel learning (TKL) approach to learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Specifically, we design a family of spectral kernels by extrapolating target eigensystem on source samples with Mercer's theorem. The spectral kernel minimizing the approximation error to the ground truth kernel is selected to construct domain-invariant kernel machines. Comprehensive experimental evidence on a large number of text categorization, image classification, and video event recognition datasets verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TKL approach over several state-of-the-art methods.",2015,49,166,29,false,Computer Science,,35776445,Mingsheng Long,2144499343,Jianmin Wang,2109517420,Jiaguang Sun,144019071,Philip S.

OTL is in general challenging since data in both domains not only can be different in their class distributions but can be also different in their feature representations. As a first attempt to this problem, we propose techniques to address two kinds of OTL tasks: one is to perform OTL in a homogeneous domain, and the other is to perform OTL across heterogeneous domains.

Different approaches to such combinatorial problems exist, among which are exact integer programming approaches (only feasible for very small sample sizes, e.g. [1]) and local search heuristics starting from a suitably chosen start value such as the approach explained in Chapter 5, Transductive Support Vector Machines , and introduced in [2] (scalable to large problem sizes, but sensitive to local optima). In this chapter, we discuss an alternative approach introduced in [3], which is based on a convex relaxation of the optimization problem associated to support vector machine transduction. The result is a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem which can be optimized in polynomial time, the solution of which is an approximation of the optimal labeling as well as a bound on the true optimum of the original transduction objective function. To further decrease the computational complexity, we propose an approximation that allows to solve transduction problems of up to 1000 unlabeled samples. Lastly, we extend the formulation to more general settings of semi-supervised learning, where equivalence and inequivalence constraints are given on labels of some of the samples.",2006,9,55,2,false,Computer Science,,51204489,T.

Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.",2021,0,318,24,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,1732570,M.

Such predictive models are increasingly being applied to the mining of panels of genetic variants, environmental, or other nongenetic factors in the prediction of various complex traits and disease phenotypes [1]–[8]. These studies are providing increasing evidence in support of the idea that machine learning provides a complementary view into the analysis of high-dimensional genetic datasets as compared to standard statistical association testing approaches. In contrast to identifying variants explaining most of the phenotypic variation at the population level, supervised machine learning models aim to maximize the predictive (or generalization) power at the level of individuals, hence providing exciting opportunities for e.g., individualized risk prediction based on personal genetic profiles [9]–[11]. Machine learning models can also deal with genetic interactions, which are known to play an important role in the development and treatment of many complex diseases [12]–[16], but are often missed by single-locus association tests [17]. Even in the absence of significant single-loci marginal effects, multilocus panels from distinct molecular pathways may provide synergistic contribution to the prediction power, thereby revealing part of such hidden heritability component that has remained missing because of too small marginal effects to pass the stringent genome-wide significance filters [18]. Multivariate modeling approaches have already been shown to provide improved insights into genetic mechanisms and the interaction networks behind many complex traits, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and lipid levels, which would have gone undetected using the standard univariate modeling [2], [19]–[22]. However, machine learning models also come with inherent pitfalls, such as increased computational complexity and the risk for model overfitting, which must be understood in order to avoid reporting unrealistic prediction models or over-optimistic prediction results. 
 
We argue here that many medical applications of machine learning models in genetic disease risk prediction rely essentially on two factors: effective model regularization and rigorous model validation. We demonstrate the effects of these factors using representative examples from the literature as well as illustrative case examples. This review is not meant to be a comprehensive survey of all predictive modeling approaches, but we focus on regularized machine learning models, which enforces constraints on the complexity of the learned models so that they would ignore irrelevant patterns in the training examples. Simple risk allele counting or other multilocus risk models that do not incorporate any model parameters to be learned are outside the scope of this review; in fact, such simplistic models that assume independent variants may lead to suboptimal prediction performance in the presence of either direct or indirect interactions through epistasis effects or linkage disequilibrium, respectively [23], [24]. Perhaps the simplest models considered here as learning approaches are those based on weighted risk allele summaries [23], [25]. However, even with such basic risk models intended for predictive purposes, it is important to learn the model parameters (e.g., select the variants and determine their weights) based on training data only; otherwise there is a severe risk of model overfitting, i.e., models not being capable of generalizing to new samples [5]. Representative examples of how model learning and regularization approaches address the overfitting problem are briefly summarized in Box 1, while those readers interested in their implementation details are referred to the accompanying Text S1. We specifically promote here the use of such regularized machine learning models that are scalable to the entire genome-wide scale, often based on linear models, which are easy to interpret and also enable straightforward variable selection. Genome-scale approaches avoid the need of relying on two-stage approaches [26], which apply standard statistical procedures to reduce the number of variants, since such prefiltering may miss predictive interactions across loci and therefore lead to reduced predictive performance [8], [24], [25], [27], [28]. 
 
 
Box 1. Synthesis of Learning Models for Genetic Risk Prediction 
The aim of risk models is to capture in a mathematical form the patterns in the genetic and non-genetic data most important for the prediction of disease susceptibility. The first step in model building involves choosing the functional form of the model (e.g., linear or nonlinear), and then making use of a given training data to determine the adjustable parameters of the model (e.g., a subset of variants, their weights, and other model parameters). While it is often sufficient for a statistical model to enable high enough explanatory power in the discovery material, without being overly complicated, a predictive model is also required to generalize to unseen cases. 
 
One consideration in the model construction is how to encode the genotypic measurements using genotype models, such as the dominant, recessive, multiplicative, or additive model, each implying different assumptions about the genetic effects in the data [79]. Categorical variables 0, 1, and 2 are typically used for treating genetic predictor variables (e.g., minor allele dosage), while numeric values are required for continuous risk factors (e.g., blood pressure). Expected posterior probabilities of the genotypes can also be used, especially for imputed genotypes. Transforming the genotype categories into three binary features is an alternative way to deal with missing values without imputation (used in the T1D example; see Text S1 for details). 
 
 
Statistical or machine learning models identify statistical or predictive interactions, respectively, rather than biological interactions between or within variants [12], [80]. While nonlinear models may better capture complex genetic interactions [7], [81], linear models are easier to interpret and provide a scalable option for performing supervised selection of multilocus variant panels at the genome-wide scale [3]. In linear models, genetic interactions are modeled implicitly by selecting such variant combinations that together are predictive of the phenotype, rather than considering pairwise gene–gene relationships explicitly. Formally, trait yi to be predicted for an individual i is modeled as a linear combination of the individual's predictor variables xij:

Here, the weights wj are assumed constant across the n individuals, w 0 is the bias offset term and p indicates the number of predictors discovered in the training data. In its basic form, Eq. 1 can be used for modeling continuous traits y (linear regression). For case-control classification, the binary dependent variable y is often transformed using a logistic loss function, which models the probability of a case class given a genotype profile and other risk factor covariates x (logistic regression). It has been shown that the logistic regression and naive Bayes risk models are mathematically very closely related in the context of genetic risk prediction [81].",2014,124,114,2,true,Biology,Medicine,2013961,S.

In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as ‘virtual screening’ (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and benchmarking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions.

However, the major challenge in these methods is obtaining real-time and unbiased datasets. Many datasets are internal and cannot be shared due to privacy issues or may lack certain statistical characteristics. As a result of this, researchers prefer to generate datasets for training and testing purpose in the simulated or closed experimental environments which may lack comprehensiveness. Machine learning models trained with such a single dataset generally result in a semantic gap between results and their application. There is a dearth of research work which demonstrates the effectiveness of these models across multiple datasets obtained in different environments.

While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles), resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across a variety of synthetic and real-world biases; our experiments show that the method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved generalisation.

Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss. The theoretical analysis shows that the DP-ADMM can be applied to a wider class of distributed learning problems, is provably convergent, and offers an explicit utility-privacy tradeoff. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide explicit convergence and utility properties for differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithms. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can achieve good convergence and model accuracy under high end-to-end differential privacy guarantee.",2018,53,96,11,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,1388738367,Zonghao Huang,1471616367,Rui Hu,1795475,Yuanxiong Guo,1400755941,E.

We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather. Empirical results demonstrate that using MTL to account for individual differences provides large performance improvements over traditional machine learning methods and provides personalized, actionable insights.",2020,61,111,11,false,Computer Science,Medicine,144996285,Sara Taylor,3106683,Natasha Jaques,9259311,Ehimwenma Nosakhare,2804453,A.

When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory locationbased focusing mechanisms.",2016,21,478,30,false,Computer Science,,35030998,Adam Santoro,2258504,Sergey Bartunov,46378362,M.

Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during training and testing. We propose FastTag, a novel algorithm that achieves comparable results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates, which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several standard real-world benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that FastTag matches the current state-of-the-art in tagging quality, yet reduces the training and testing times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity.",2013,28,213,47,false,Mathematics,Computer Science,1743082,Minmin Chen,3001424,A.

However, the performance of machines in providing rich semantic descriptions of natural scenes from digital images remains highly limited and hugely inferior to that of humans. Here we quantify this “semantic gap” in a particular setting: We compare the efficiency of human and machine learning in assigning an image to one of two categories determined by the spatial arrangement of constituent parts. The images are not real, but the category-defining rules reflect the compositional structure of real images and the type of “reasoning” that appears to be necessary for semantic parsing. Experiments demonstrate that human subjects grasp the separating principles from a handful of examples, whereas the error rates of computer programs fluctuate wildly and remain far behind that of humans even after exposure to thousands of examples. These observations lend support to current trends in computer vision such as integrating machine learning with parts-based modeling.",2011,32,112,22,true,Computer Science,Medicine,2721983,F.

(difference of convex functions) programs as a sequence of convex programs. In machine learning, CCCP is extensively used in many learning algorithms like sparse support vector machines (SVMs), transductive SVMs, sparse principal component analysis, etc. Though widely used in many applications, the convergence behavior of CCCP has not gotten a lot of specific attention. Yuille and Rangarajan analyzed its convergence in their original paper, however, we believe the analysis is not complete. Although the convergence of CCCP can be derived from the convergence of the d.c. algorithm (DCA), its proof is more specialized and technical than actually required for the specific case of CCCP. In this paper, we follow a different reasoning and show how Zangwill's global convergence theory of iterative algorithms provides a natural framework to prove the convergence of CCCP, allowing a more elegant and simple proof. This underlines Zangwill's theory as a powerful and general framework to deal with the convergence issues of iterative algorithms, after also being used to prove the convergence of algorithms like expectation-maximization, generalized alternating minimization, etc. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence of CCCP by addressing these questions: (i) When does CCCP find a local minimum or a stationary point of the d.c. program under consideration? (ii) When does the sequence generated by CCCP converge? We also present an open problem on the issue of local convergence of CCCP.",2009,36,418,42,false,Computer Science,,3313411,Bharath K.

The IMS Learning Design specification aims to represent the learning design of units of learning in a semantic, formal and machine interpretable way. Since its release in 2003 various parties have been active to develop tools, to experiment with Learning Design in practice, or to do research on the further advancement of the specification. The aim of this special issue is to provide an overview of current work in the area. This papers introduces Learning Design, analyses the different papers and provides an overview of current research in Learning Design. The major research issues are at the moment: a) the use of ontologies and semantic web principles & tools related to Learning Design; b) the use of learning design patterns; c) the development of learrning design authoring and content management systems, and d) the development of learning design players, including the issues how to use the integrated set of learning design tools in a variety of settings.",2006,46,227,14,false,Computer Science,,1747579,R.

In many different areas, the research bottleneck is no longer in data collection, but rather in data interpretation. Often, the underlying processes described by the data are very complex, compounding the problem. In response, much research in computer analysis of large datasets is under way. Machine learning is one of the fields responding to the challenge of this problem. 
This thesis considers the interpretation of machine learning problems and techniques under a geometric model. Geometry is a useful for several reasons. It aids in visualization, allowing for alternative ways of thinking. It provides a rigorous framework for analyzing learning problems and methods. It suggests modifications to methods which can increase their usefulness and efficiency. 
In this thesis, geometric analysis is used to formulate and analyze two theoretical machine learning problems and to improve an existing machine learning method. A form of best-case analysis is presented which can be used to generate bounds on the number of examples needed for learning. A formal trade-off between available memory and speed of learning is established. In addition, geometry is used to generalize the decision tree method of machine learning. An algorithm for learning based on this generalization is presented, and its usefulness is demonstrated on a variety of artificial and real-world databases.",1993,0,49,9,false,Computer Science,,2059696865,David G.

Machine-learning may offer potential to explore outcomes of even greater complexity, such as premature death. This study aimed to develop novel prediction algorithms using machine-learning, in addition to standard survival modelling, to predict premature all-cause mortality. Methods A prospective population cohort of 502,628 participants aged 40–69 years were recruited to the UK Biobank from 2006–2010 and followed-up until 2016. Participants were assessed on a range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle factors. Mortality data by ICD-10 were obtained from linkage to Office of National Statistics. Models were developed using deep learning, random forest and Cox regression. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed to predicted risks; and discrimination by area under the ‘receiver operating curve’ (AUC). Findings 14,418 deaths (2.9%) occurred over a total follow-up time of 3,508,454 person-years. A simple age and gender Cox model was the least predictive (AUC 0.689, 95% CI 0.681–0.699). A multivariate Cox regression model significantly improved discrimination by 6.2% (AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.748–0.767). The application of machine-learning algorithms further improved discrimination by 3.2% using random forest (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.776–0.791) and 3.9% using deep learning (AUC 0.790, 95% CI 0.783–0.797). These ML algorithms improved discrimination by 9.4% and 10.1% respectively from a simple age and gender Cox regression model. Random forest and deep learning achieved similar levels of discrimination with no significant difference. Machine-learning algorithms were well-calibrated, while Cox regression models consistently over-predicted risk. Conclusions Machine-learning significantly improved accuracy of prediction of premature all-cause mortality in this middle-aged population, compared to standard methods. This study illustrates the value of machine-learning for risk prediction within a traditional epidemiological study design, and how this approach might be reported to assist scientific verification.",2019,38,58,0,true,Medicine,,8955394,S.
