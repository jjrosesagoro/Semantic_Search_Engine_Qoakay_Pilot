However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.",2018,241,166,8,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,3191461.0,Wouter M.

To choose the best algorithms for a specific task, users are advised to consider not only classification accuracy, but also comprehensibility, compactness, and robustness in training and classification. The purpose of this paper is to provide information to users so that they can choose the best algorithms for specific tasks. To alleviate the problem of obtaining enough training data, simulated training data were generated from single-date images. A one-pass classification with four machine learning algorithms, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Tree Classifiers (DTC), and the Maximum-Likelihood Classifier (MLC), were tested. Recognition rates, ease of use, and degree of automation of the four algorithms were assessed. The results showed that the incorporation of cross-combined simulated training data enhanced the detection of nature of change. Compared to conventional post-classification comparison methods, LVQ and DTC did better in terms of overall accuracy. In terms of average accuracy of the change classes, LVQ was the best performer. DTC was the easiest to use and the most robust in training. MLP procedures were the most difficult to replicate.",2001,30,158,4,False,Geography,,27026134.0,J.

Considering the ever-increasing complexity of the network, and the emergence of novel use cases such as autonomous cars, industrial automation, virtual reality, e-health, and several intelligent applications, machine learning (ML) is expected to be essential to assist in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper focuses on the potential solutions for 5G from an ML-perspective. First, we establish the fundamental concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, taking a look at what has been done so far in the adoption of ML in the context of mobile and wireless communication, organizing the literature in terms of the types of learning. We then discuss the promising approaches for how ML can contribute to supporting each target 5G network requirement, emphasizing its specific use cases and evaluating the impact and limitations they have on the operation of the network. Lastly, this paper investigates the potential features of Beyond 5G (B5G), providing future research directions for how ML can contribute to realizing B5G.

Machine learning methods may excel at finding new features or nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as handling settings with more predictor variables than observations. However, the usefulness of both these data and machine learning has varied. Electronic health data often have quality issues (eg, missingness, misclassification, measurement error), and machine learning may perform similarly to standard techniques for some research questions. Ensembles (running multiple algorithms and either selecting the single best algorithm or creating a weighted average) can help mitigate the latter concern. Using several machine learning tools, Wong et al1 predicted delirium risk for newly hospitalized patients with high-dimensional electronic health record data at a large academic health institution. They compared these approaches with a questionnaire-based scoring system and found improved performance for machine learning with respect to several metrics calculated in a single holdout sample. Their article is a step toward updating delirium risk prediction. It also provides an opportunity to discuss 2 key issues in the current state of machine learning for prediction in electronic health data: evaluation and generalizability. The machine learning researchers who develop novel algorithms for prediction and the clinical teams interested in implementing them are frequently and unfortunately 2 nonintersecting groups. Thus, these algorithms may originally be built and evaluated in the machine learning literature based on metrics that are less clinically useful than other choices. Computer scientists and statisticians may optimize to achieve the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), but what a clinical team might need is high sensitivity or positive predictive value. Worse yet, algorithms can have misleading performance when evaluated only along 1 or 2 dimensions. For example, high AUC, accuracy, and positive predictive values can be accompanied by near-zero levels of sensitivity and specificity. It can also be essential to calculate metrics like the percentage of true cases in the top risk percentile.2 This is especially important when a goal of the tool is to target high-risk patients for interventions. Wong and colleagues1 helpfully compute AUC, positive predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. However, one accepted standard for evaluation that should be adopted in future clinical machine learning applications is K-fold cross-validation (eg, with K = 10) rather than the single holdout validation sample in their article. K-fold cross-validation involves K successive mutually exclusive validation sets where the algorithm fitting is iteratively performed on the nonvalidation data (ie, training set). At the end, each observation in the full data has a predicted value that was obtained from when it was part of a validation set. Typically, metrics calculated based on these K-fold cross-validated predicted values will more effectively assess overfitting and have lower variance.3 Of course, assessing the generalizability of a prediction algorithm goes well beyond using crossvalidated metrics to evaluate overfitting. Wong et al1 carefully discussed a number of limitations in their work, including the lack of external validation in other health systems. As in similar studies, the step from good performance in the study to a generalizable algorithm is vast and sometimes may not be feasible. Patients receiving treatment in varied care settings or geographic regions simply may require tailored tools. Recognizing the need for unique tools in different populations is not inherently negative, but one of many considerations not magically solved by using machine learning. Even those algorithms that prove to be generalizable may quickly become outdated as treatment patterns or physician incentives to code health conditions change.4 Increased social tolerance for certain + Related article",2018,11,54,1,True,Computer Science,Medicine,48345067.0,Sherri Rose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the existing relevant state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method requires less detection time and achieves higher detection accuracy.",2015,54,334,17,False,Computer Science,,2967405.0,Jiexiong Tang,7175017.0,Chenwei Deng,145678691.0,G.

To this end, a large number of special purpose systems and techniques have been developed for solving such constraint-based mining and learning problems. These techniques have, so far, been developed independently of the general purpose tools and principles of constraint programming known within the field of artificial intelligence. This paper shows that off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques can be applied to various pattern mining and rule learning problems (cf. also (De Raedt, Guns, and Nijssen 2008; Nijssen, Guns, and De Raedt 2009)).

Machine learning techniques are playing key roles in this field. Typically, predictors based on machine learning techniques contain three main steps: feature extraction, predictor construction and performance evaluation. Although several Web servers and stand-alone tools have been developed to facilitate the biological sequence analysis, they only focus on individual step. In this regard, in this study a powerful Web server called BioSeq-Analysis (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/) has been proposed to automatically complete the three main steps for constructing a predictor. The user only needs to upload the benchmark data set. BioSeq-Analysis can generate the optimized predictor based on the benchmark data set, and the performance measures can be reported as well. Furthermore, to maximize user's convenience, its stand-alone program was also released, which can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/download/, and can be directly run on Windows, Linux and UNIX.

Vapnik (1995)] and the vector space representation of citations, a discriminative model.

Especially when classification is to be performed over many categories, providing enough training samples for each category is infeasible. This paper describes new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with little loss in accuracy. Thorough empirical evaluation of classification accuracy, noise sensitivity, imbalanced data, and computational performance on a diverse set of image datasets demonstrates the strengths of the proposed algorithms.",2012,55,121,11,True,Computer Science,Medicine,1692604.0,Ajay J.

These approaches yield global or class-specific measures of map quality by comparing classification results with independent ground-truth data. In most maps, considerable spatial variation is present in the accuracy of land cover labels that is not captured by these statistics. To date, this issue has rarely been addressed in the land cover remote sensing literature. The authors present a method to estimate pixel-scale land cover classification confidence using nonparametric machine learning methods. The method is based on recent theoretical developments from the domains of statistics and machine learning that explain the machine learning technique known as ""boosting"" as being equivalent to additive logistic regression. As a result, results from classification algorithms that use boosting can be assigned classification confidences based on probability estimates assigned to them using this theory. they test this approach using three different data sets. Their results demonstrate that classification errors tend to have low classification confidence while correctly classified pixels tend to have higher confidence. Thus, the method described in this paper may be used as a basis for providing spatially explicit maps of classification quality. This type of information will provide substantial additional information regarding map quality relative to more conventional quality measures and should be useful to end-users of map products derived from remote sensing.",2001,58,102,5,False,Computer Science,,40299392.0,D.

Graph neural networks equipped with such layers are able to perform both geometric and relational reasoning on efficient and natural representations of macromolecular structure.

Furthermore, choosing the correct order in which to apply those optimizations has been a long standing problem in compilation research. Each of these optimizations interacts with the code and in turn with all other optimizations in complicated ways. Traditional compilers typically apply the same set of optimization in a fixed order to all functions in a program, without regard the code being optimized. Understanding the interactions of optimizations is very important in determining a good solution to the phase-ordering problem. This paper develops a new approach that automatically selects good optimization orderings on a per method basis within a dynamic compiler. Our approach formulates the phase-ordering problem as a Markov process and uses a characterization of the current state of the code being optimized to creating a better solution to the phase ordering problem. Our technique uses neuro-evolution to construct an artificial neural network that is capable of predicting beneficial optimization ordering for a piece of code that is being optimized.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.",2020,18,236,27,False,Computer Science,,39483391.0,Hao Wang,2005216177.0,Zakhary Kaplan,1714907.0,Di Niu,91269142.0,Baochun Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use noisy, differentially-private gradients to minimize the fitness cost of the machine learning model using stochastic gradient descent. We quantify the quality of the trained model, using the fitness cost, as a function of privacy budget and size of the distributed datasets to capture the trade-off between privacy and utility in machine learning. This way, we can predict the outcome of collaboration among privacy-aware data owners prior to executing potentially computationally-expensive machine learning algorithms. Particularly, we show that the difference between the fitness of the trained machine learning model using differentially-private gradient queries and the fitness of the trained machine model in the absence of any privacy concerns is inversely proportional to the size of the training datasets squared and the privacy budget squared. We successfully validate the performance prediction with the actual performance of the proposed privacy-aware learning algorithms, applied to: financial datasets for determining interest rates of loans using regression; and detecting credit card frauds using support vector machines.",2019,35,44,4,True,Computer Science,Mathematics,2068343830.0,Nan Wu,145788331.0,Farhad Farokhi,2153149908.0,David B.

Using spatial clustering and temporal alignment, each gesture is defined to be an ordered sequence of states in spatial-temporal space. The 2D image positions of the centers of the head and both hands of the user are used as features; these are located by a color-based tracking method. From training data of a given gesture, we first learn the spatial information and then group the data into segments that are automatically aligned temporally. The temporal information is further integrated to build a finite state machine (FSM) recognizer. Each gesture has a FSM corresponding to it. The computational efficiency of the FSM recognizers allows us to achieve real-time on-line performance.

Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.",2020,35,62,6,True,Computer Science,,1491639926.0,Jiongming Qin,2118537154.0,Lin Chen,2108173123.0,Yuhua Liu,50557626.0,Chuanjun Liu,,15939357.0,Changhao Feng,2146711235.0,Bin Chen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These techniques are evaluated in a comprehensive suite of experiments, for which nearly four million classification models were trained. All classifiers are assessed using seven different performance metrics, providing a complete perspective on the performance of these techniques, and results are tested for statistical significance via analysis-of-variance modeling.

The learning process for generator and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable to discriminate between the true and the generated data. This Letter introduces the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks, where the data consist either of quantum states or of classical data, and the generator and discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the generator produces the same statistics as the data. Neither the generator nor the discriminator perform quantum tomography; linear programing drives them to the optimal. Since quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic, the proof of the quantum case is different from-and simpler than-the classical case. We show that, when the data consist of samples of measurements made on high-dimensional spaces, quantum adversarial networks may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical adversarial networks.",2018,21,231,9,True,Medicine,Computer Science,145762777.0,S.

Although many intelligibility techniques have been proposed in the machine learning literature, there are many more open questions about how best to provide stakeholders with the information they need to achieve their desired goals. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the intelligible machine learning landscape and give several examples of the diverse ways in which needs for intelligibility can arise. We provide an overview of the techniques for achieving intelligibility that have been proposed in the machine learning literature. We discuss the importance of taking a human-centered strategy when designing intelligibility techniques or when verifying that these techniques achieve their intended goals. We also argue that the notion of intelligibility should be expanded beyond machine learning models to other components of machine learning systems, such as datasets and performance metrics.

This paper presents three supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for prediction of the activation patterns of muscles and sensory data, based on the history of sensory data, for walking assisted by a functional electrical stimulation (FES). Those ML's are: (1) a multilayer perceptron with Levenberg-Marquardt modification of backpropagation learning algorithm; (2) an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); and (3) a combination of an entropy minimization type of inductive learning (IL) technique and a radial basis function (RBF) type of artificial neural network with orthogonal least squares learning algorithm. Here we show the prediction of the activation of the knee flexor muscles and the knee joint angle for seven consecutive strides based on the history of the knee joint angle and the ground reaction forces. The data used for training and testing of ML's was obtained from a simulation of walking assisted with an FES system. The ability of generating rules for an FES controller was selected as the most important criterion when comparing the ML's. Other criteria such as generalization of results, computational complexity, and learning rate mere also considered. The minimal number of rules and the most explicit and comprehensible rules were obtained by ANFIS.

Today, however, it is possible to use the unprecedented amount of information generated by pervasive mobile phones to provide insights into the dynamics of both individual and group behavior. Information such as continuous proximity, location, communication and activity data, has been gathered from the phones of 100 human subjects at MIT. Systematic measurements from these 100 people over the course of eight months have generated one of the largest datasets of continuous human behavior ever collected, representing over 300,000 hours of daily activity. In this thesis we describe how this data can be used to uncover regular rules and structure in behavior of both individuals and organizations, infer relationships between subjects, verify selfreport survey data, and study social network dynamics.

This leads to an overestimation of the importance of the features extracted from the training data and found to be discriminating for these small sets of authors. Most studies also use sizes of training data that are unrealistic for situations in which stylometry is applied (e.g., forensics), and thereby overestimate the accuracy of their approach in these situations. A more realistic interpretation of the task is as an authorship verification problem that we approximate by pooling data from many different authors as negative examples. In this paper, we show, on the basis of a new corpus with 145 authors, what the effect is of many authors on feature selection and learning, and show robustness of a memory-based learning approach in doing authorship attribution and verification with many authors and limited training data when compared to eager learning methods such as SVMs and maximum entropy learning.",2008,30,168,12,True,Computer Science,,1746388.0,Kim Luyckx,1735272.0,Walter Daelemans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Albeit its significant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move a significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of challenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output examples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their parse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is almost 0%. We tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space. Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the model effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test accuracy on test inputs that are 500x longer than the training samples.",2017,37,42,2,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,1425082935.0,Xinyun Chen,2118484320.0,Chang Liu,143711382.0,D.

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features.",2020,237,54,3,True,Computer Science,Medicine,26938970.0,Mohsen Shahhosseini,2617141.0,Guiping Hu,3476034.0,S.

The core idea is to enlarge the distance between different classes under the conceptual framework of LSR. First, a technique called ε-dragging is introduced to force the regression targets of different classes moving along opposite directions such that the distances between classes can be enlarged. Then, the ε-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of L2,1 norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection. The model for multiclass classification and its extension for feature selection are finally solved elegantly and efficiently.

In an ideal setting, we want to encrypt sensitive data to store them on a commercial cloud and run certain analyses without ever decrypting the data to preserve privacy. Homomorphic encryption technique is a promising candidate for secure data outsourcing, but it is a very challenging task to support real-world machine learning tasks. Existing frameworks can only handle simplified cases with low-degree polynomials such as linear means classifier and linear discriminative analysis. Objective The goal of this study is to provide a practical support to the mainstream learning models (eg, logistic regression). Methods We adapted a novel homomorphic encryption scheme optimized for real numbers computation. We devised (1) the least squares approximation of the logistic function for accuracy and efficiency (ie, reduce computation cost) and (2) new packing and parallelization techniques. Results Using real-world datasets, we evaluated the performance of our model and demonstrated its feasibility in speed and memory consumption. For example, it took approximately 116 minutes to obtain the training model from the homomorphically encrypted Edinburgh dataset. In addition, it gives fairly accurate predictions on the testing dataset.

One approach circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains. Our novel architecture results in a model that outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and additionally produces visualizations of the private and shared representations enabling interpretation of the domain adaptation process.",2016,34,1045,122,False,Computer Science,,2732737.0,Konstantinos Bousmalis,2814229.0,George Trigeorgis,2286640.0,N.

Its accurate evaluation from first principles requires quantum chemistry methods that are often too demanding for routine use. The highly accurate calculations reported herein provide a much-needed benchmark of the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as well as training data for a machine-learning model that can predict the polarizability tensor with an error that is about 50% smaller than DFT. This framework provides an accurate, inexpensive, and transferable strategy for estimating the polarizabilities of molecules containing dozens of atoms, and therefore removes a considerable obstacle to accurate and reliable atomistic-based modeling of matter. The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT.

We motivate our work from the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.",2013,65,150,10,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,1854385.0,Çaglar Gülçehre,1751762.0,Yoshua Bengio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard federated learning techniques are vulnerable to Byzantine failures, biased local datasets, and poisoning attacks. In this paper we introduce Adaptive Federated Averaging, a novel algorithm for robust federated learning that is designed to detect failures, attacks, and bad updates provided by participants in a collaborative model. We propose a Hidden Markov Model to model and learn the quality of model updates provided by each participant during training. In contrast to existing robust federated learning schemes, we propose a robust aggregation rule that detects and discards bad or malicious local model updates at each training iteration. This includes a mechanism that blocks unwanted participants, which also increases the computational and communication efficiency. Our experimental evaluation on 4 real datasets show that our algorithm is significantly more robust to faulty, noisy and malicious participants, whilst being computationally more efficient than other state-of-the-art robust federated learning methods such as Multi-KRUM and coordinate-wise median.",2019,26,69,7,False,Mathematics,Computer Science,1399031454.0,Luis Muñoz-González,84511897.0,Kenneth T.

This training typically involves many iterations that continually improve the quality of the model. Yet in exploratory settings, better models can be obtained faster by directing resources to jobs with the most potential for improvement. We describe SLAQ, a cluster scheduling system for approximate ML training jobs that aims to maximize the overall job quality. When allocating cluster resources, SLAQ explores the quality-runtime trade-offs across multiple jobs to maximize system-wide quality improvement. To do so, SLAQ leverages the iterative nature of ML training algorithms, by collecting quality and resource usage information from concurrent jobs, and then generating highly-tailored quality-improvement predictions for future iterations. Experiments show that SLAQ achieves an average quality improvement of up to 73% and an average delay reduction of up to 44% on a large set of ML training jobs, compared to resource fairness schedulers.",2017,59,99,14,True,Computer Science,,2051632731.0,Haoyu Zhang,26315993.0,Logan Stafman,46782066.0,Andrew Or,3122063.0,M.

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real‐world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to‐date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.",2021,239,68,2,False,Medicine,,6609752.0,A.

Products today are built with machine intelligence as a central attribute, and consumers are beginning to expect near-human interaction with the appliances they use. However, much of the deep learning revolution has been limited to the cloud. Recently, several machine learning packages based on edge devices have been announced which aim to offload the computing to the edges. However, little research has been done to evaluate these packages on the edges, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we make a performance comparison of several state-of-the-art machine learning packages on the edges, including TensorFlow, Caffe2, MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow Lite.

Ideally, a machine learning algorithm should make a prediction only when it is highly certain about its competency, and refer the case to physicians otherwise. In this paper, we investigate how Bayesian deep learning can improve the performance of the machine–physician team in the skin lesion classification task. We used the publicly available HAM10000 dataset, which includes samples from seven common skin lesion categories: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic Nevi (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC), Benign Keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), and Vascular (VASC) lesions. Our experimental results show that Bayesian deep networks can boost the diagnostic performance of the standard DenseNet-169 model from 81.35% to 83.59% without incurring additional parameters or heavy computation. More importantly, a hybrid physician–machine workflow reaches a classification accuracy of 90% while only referring 35% of the cases to physicians. The findings are expected to generalize to other medical diagnosis applications.
