This technology has recently attracted so much interest of the Medical Imaging Community that it led to a specialized conference in “Medical Imaging with Deep Learning” in the year 2018. This paper surveys the recent developments in this direction and provides a critical review of the related major aspects. We organize the reviewed literature according to the underlying pattern recognition tasks and further sub-categorize it following a taxonomy based on human anatomy. This paper does not assume prior knowledge of deep learning and makes a significant contribution in explaining the core deep learning concepts to the non-experts in the Medical Community. This paper provides a unique computer vision/machine learning perspective taken on the advances of deep learning in medical imaging. This enables us to single out “lack of appropriately annotated large-scale data sets” as the core challenge (among other challenges) in this research direction.

Unlike English as a Second Language ( ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3 D virtual world, Open Simulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts ( VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot ( VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine ( VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine ( VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.

The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods).

With the advent of more widely distributed computing power, methods which require more complex mathematics have become increasingly common. Particularly in this era of ""big data"" and machine learning, survival analysis has become methodologically broader. This paper aims to explore one technique known as Random Forest. The Random Forest technique is a regression tree technique which uses bootstrap aggregation and randomization of predictors to achieve a high degree of predictive accuracy. The various input parameters of the random forest are explored. Colon cancer data (n = 66,807) from the SEER database is then used to construct both a Cox model and a random forest model to determine how well the models perform on the same data.

A potential remedy is offered by multi-task learning: in many cases, while individual sample sizes are rather small, there are samples to represent a large number of learning tasks (linear regression problems), which share some constraining or generative property. If this property is sufficiently simple it should allow for better learning of the individual tasks despite their small individual sample sizes. In this talk I will review a wide class of multi-task learning methods which encourage low-dimensional representations of the regression vectors. I will describe techniques to solve the underlying optimization problems and present an analysis of the generalization performance of these learning methods which provides a proof of the superiority of multi-task learning under specific conditions.

But can it also be used to find novel protocols and algorithms for applications such as large-scale quantum communication? Here we show that machine learning can be used to identify central quantum protocols, including teleportation, entanglement purification and the quantum repeater. These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication, and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness of learning agents goes beyond the mere re-production of known protocols; the same approach allows one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing with asymmetric situations where channel noise and segment distance are non-uniform. Our findings are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions. We utilize an idea reminiscent of hierarchical skill acquisition, where solutions to sub-problems are learned and re-used in the overall scheme. This is of particular importance in the development of long-distance communication schemes, and opens the way for using machine learning in the design and implementation of quantum networks.",2019,69,48,2,True,Computer Science,Physics,67091356,J.

The SVM is well understood when using conditionally positive definite (cpd) kernel functions. However, in practice, non-cpd kernels arise and demand application in SVM. The procedure of ""plugging"" these indefinite kernels in SVM often yields good empirical classification results. However, they are hard to interpret due to missing geometrical and theoretical understanding. In this paper, we provide a step toward the comprehension of SVM classifiers in these situations. We give a geometric interpretation of SVM with indefinite kernel functions. We show that such SVM are optimal hyperplane classifiers not by margin maximization, but by minimization of distances between convex hulls in pseudo-Euclidean spaces. By this, we obtain a sound framework and motivation for indefinite SVM. This interpretation is the basis for further theoretical analysis, e.g., investigating uniqueness, and for the derivation of practical guidelines like characterizing the suitability of indefinite SVM.",2005,32,255,18,True,Mathematics,Computer Science,2800929,B.

In this paper we explore approaches for automatic recognition of engagement from students' facial expressions. We studied whether human observers can reliably judge engagement from the face; analyzed the signals observers use to make these judgments; and automated the process using machine learning. We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's κ = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high ( κ = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r=0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers. We used machine learning to develop automatic engagement detectors and found that for binary classification (e.g., high engagement versus low engagement), automated engagement detectors perform with comparable accuracy to humans. Finally, we show that both human and automatic engagement judgments correlate with task performance.

In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights.

In these tasks, one is often confronted with very high-dimensional data. FS algorithms are designed to identify the relevant feature subset from the original features, which can facilitate subsequent analysis, such as clustering and classification. Structured sparsity-inducing feature selection (SSFS) methods have been widely studied in the last few years, and a number of algorithms have been proposed. However, there is no comprehensive study concerning the connections between different SSFS methods, and how they have evolved. In this paper, we attempt to provide a survey on various SSFS methods, including their motivations and mathematical representations. We then explore the relationship among different formulations and propose a taxonomy to elucidate their evolution. We group the existing SSFS methods into two categories, i.e., vector-based feature selection (feature selection based on lasso) and matrix-based feature selection (feature selection based on  ${l_{r,p}}$ -norm). Furthermore, FS has been combined with other machine learning algorithms for specific applications, such as multitask learning, multilabel learning, multiview learning, classification, and clustering. This paper not only compares the differences and commonalities of these methods based on regression and regularization strategies, but also provides useful guidelines to practitioners working in related fields to guide them how to do feature selection.",2017,169,141,4,False,Computer Science,,143987790,Jie Gui,1757186.0,Zhenan Sun,1743600.0,Shuiwang Ji,143719920.0,D.

The flaws in the e-mail protocols and the increasing amount of electronic business and financial transactions directly contribute to the increase in e-mail-based threats. Email spam is one of the major problems of the today‟s Internet, bringing financial damage to companies and annoying individual users. Spam emails are invading users without their consent and filling their mail boxes. They consume more network capacity as well as time in checking and deleting spam mails. The vast majority of Internet users are outspoken in their disdain for spam, although enough of them respond to commercial offers that spam remains a viable source of income to spammers. While most of the users want to do right think to avoid and get rid of spam, they need clear and simple guidelines on how to behave. In spite of all the measures taken to eliminate spam, they are not yet eradicated. Also when the counter measures are over sensitive, even legitimate emails will be eliminated. Among the approaches developed to stop spam, filtering is the one of the most important technique.

However, it remains an outstanding task because of the great challenges in effective spatial-temporal feature extraction and efficient classification with high-dimensional video representations. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework called deep ensemble machine (DEM) for video classification. Specifically, to establish effective spatio-temporal features, we propose using two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), i.e., vision and graphics group and C3-D to extract heterogeneous spatial and temporal features for complementary representations. To achieve efficient classification, we propose ensemble learning based on random projections aiming to transform high-dimensional features into a set of lower dimensional compact features in subspaces; an ensemble of classifiers is trained on the subspaces and combined with a weighting layer during the backpropagation. To further enhance the performance, we introduce rectified linear encoding (RLE) inspired from error-correcting output coding to encode the initial outputs of classifiers, followed by a softmax layer to produce the final classification results. DEM combines the strengths of deep CNNs and ensemble learning, which establishes a new end-to-end learning architecture for more accurate and efficient video classification. We show the great effectiveness of DEM by extensive experiments on four data sets for diverse video classification tasks including action recognition and dynamic scene classification. Results have shown that DEM achieves high performance on all tasks with an improvement of up to 13% on CIFAR10 data set over the baseline model.",2019,73,38,2,False,Computer Science,Medicine,23124669,Jiewan Zheng,40916581.0,Xianbin Cao,1740430.0,Baochang Zhang,34798935.0,Xiantong Zhen,7883602.0,Xiangbo Su,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.

These inputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected perturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired misclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific to the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be conveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual appearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more security-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose significant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for failure. 
In this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample crafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The application domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints in the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision domain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete, often binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance unchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of malware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set. We furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against adversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification. While feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation and re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.",2016,28,343,27,False,Computer Science,,39221858,Kathrin Grosse,1967156.0,Nicolas Papernot,2134700604.0,Praveen Manoharan,144588806.0,M.

The resulting data is ""born"" geographically distributed. On the other hand, many machine learning applications require a global view of such data in order to achieve the best results. These types of applications form a new class of learning problems, which we call Geo-Distributed Machine Learning (GDML). Such applications need to cope with: 1) scarce and expensive cross-data center bandwidth, and 2) growing privacy concerns that are pushing for stricter data sovereignty regulations. Current solutions to learning from geo-distributed data sources revolve around the idea of first centralizing the data in one data center, and then training locally. As machine learning algorithms are communication-intensive, the cost of centralizing the data is thought to be offset by the lower cost of intra-data center communication during training. In this work, we show that the current centralized practice can be far from optimal, and propose a system for doing geo-distributed training. Furthermore, we argue that the geo-distributed approach is structurally more amenable to dealing with regulatory constraints, as raw data never leaves the source data center. Our empirical evaluation on three real datasets confirms the general validity of our approach, and shows that GDML is not only possible but also advisable in many scenarios.",2016,58,43,3,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,151032942,Ignacio Cano,2965406.0,Markus Weimer,144542135.0,D.

Chronic kidney disease involves conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy. You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage. . Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. Data Mining is the term used for knowledge discovery from large databases. The task of data mining is to make use of historical data, to discover regular patterns and improve future decisions, follows from the convergence of several recent trends: the lessening cost of large data storage devices and the everincreasing ease of collecting data over networks; the expansion of robust and efficient machine learning algorithms to process this data; and the lessening cost of computational power, enabling use of computationally intensive methods for data analysis. Machine learning, has already created practical applications in such areas as analyzing medical science outcomes, detecting fraud, detecting fake users etc. Various data mining classification approaches and machine learning algorithms are applied for prediction of chronic diseases. The objective of this research work is to introduce a new decision support system to predict chronic kidney disease. The aim of this work is to compare the performance of Support vector machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier on the basis of its accuracy, precision and execution time for CKD prediction.

Surprisingly, these models have been hardly explored in text generation applications such as machine translation. In principle, they provide a latent variable to control generation and produce a diverse set of hypotheses. In practice, however, mixture models are prone to degeneracies---often only one component gets trained or the latent variable is simply ignored. We find that disabling dropout noise in responsibility computation is critical to successful training. In addition, the design choices of parameterization, prior distribution, hard versus soft EM and online versus offline assignment can dramatically affect model performance. We develop an evaluation protocol to assess both quality and diversity of generations against multiple references, and provide an extensive empirical study of several mixture model variants. Our analysis shows that certain types of mixture models are more robust and offer the best trade-off between translation quality and diversity compared to variational models and diverse decoding approaches.\footnote{Code to reproduce the results in this paper is available at \url{this https URL}}",2019,41,91,25,False,Computer Science,,3456570,T.

The equivalence of a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) to a generalized single hidden-layer feedforward network is shown first, which is then used to develop the OS-fuzzy-ELM algorithm. This results in a FIS that can handle any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous membership function. Furthermore, the learning in OS-fuzzy-ELM can be done with the input data coming in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk (a block of data) mode with fixed or varying chunk size. In OS-fuzzy-ELM, all the antecedent parameters of membership functions are randomly assigned first, and then, the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. Performance comparisons of OS-fuzzy-ELM with other existing algorithms are presented using real-world benchmark problems in the areas of nonlinear system identification, regression, and classification. The results show that the proposed OS-fuzzy-ELM produces similar or better accuracies with at least an order-of-magnitude reduction in the training time.",2009,26,322,25,False,Mathematics,Medicine,2774247,Hai-Jun Rong,145678691.0,G.

Moreover, it is time-consuming to manually label huge amounts of driving data due to uncertainties of driver behavior and variances among the data analysts. To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points. First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a $ k$ -means clustering method. Then, a specific differentiable surrogate of a loss function is developed, which makes it feasible to use standard optimization tools to solve the nonconvex optimization problem. One of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is then used to assign the optimal label to all of the training data. Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data. Experiments show that the S3VM method can improve the classification accuracy by about 10% and reduce the labeling effort by using only a few labeled data clusters among huge amounts of unlabeled data.",2017,46,129,4,False,Computer Science,,2108270996,Wenshuo Wang,2466765.0,Junqiang Xi,2058487323.0,Alexandre Chong,47681623.0,Lin Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike conventional machine learning situations, data flow targeted by incremental learning becomes available continuously over time. Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to abandon the traditional assumption of the availability of representative training data during the training period to develop decision boundaries. Under scenarios of continuous data flow, the challenge is how to transform the vast amount of stream raw data into information and knowledge representation, and accumulate experience over time to support future decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a general adaptive incremental learning framework named ADAIN that is capable of learning from continuous raw data, accumulating experience over time, and using such knowledge to improve future learning and prediction performance. Detailed system level architecture and design strategies are presented in this paper.

Using spatial clustering and temporal alignment, each gesture is defined to be an ordered sequence of states in spatial-temporal space. The 2D image positions of the centers of the head and both hands of the user are used as features; these are located by a color-based tracking method. From training data of a given gesture, we first learn the spatial information and then group the data into segments that are automatically aligned temporally. The temporal information is further integrated to build a finite state machine (FSM) recognizer. Each gesture has a FSM corresponding to it. The computational efficiency of the FSM recognizers allows us to achieve real-time on-line performance.

The descriptor space encompasses simple binary molecular fingerprint, one- and two-dimensional constitutional, physicochemical, and topological descriptors, and sophisticated three-dimensional molecular fields that require appropriate structural alignments of varied chemical scaffolds in one universal chemical space. The affinities were modeled using qualitative classification or quantitative regression schemes involving linear, nonlinear, and deep neural network (DNN) machine-learning methods used in the scientific literature for quantitative-structure activity relationships (QSAR). In a departure from tradition, ∼20% of the chemically diverse data set (205 compounds) was used to train the model with the remaining ∼80% of the structural and chemical analogs used as part of an external validation (1273 compounds) and prospective test (69 compounds) sets respectively to ascertain the model performance. The machine-learning methods investigated herein performed well in both the qualitative classification (∼70% accuracy) and quantitative IC50 predictions (RMSE ∼ 1 log).

To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and in analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts.

In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar’s chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 ± 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 ± 0.017), random forests (0.739 ± 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 ± 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar’s test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified.

And though highly variable when considered as a whole, individual views of things are experienced in a specific order – with slow, smooth visual changes moment-to-moment, and developmentally ordered transitions in scene content. We propose that the skewed, ordered, biased visual experiences of infants and toddlers are the training data that allow human learners to develop a way to recognize everything, both the pervasively present entities and the rarely encountered ones.

Methods We employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review. Results Three hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering. Conclusions Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration.

Tumor characterization through such tools can also enable non-invasive cancer staging, prognosis, and foster personalized treatment planning as a part of precision medicine. In this papet, we propose both supervised and unsupervised machine learning strategies to improve tumor characterization. Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D convolutional neural network and transfer learning. Motivated by the radiologists’ interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task-dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse multi-task learning framework. In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised learning algorithm to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion approaches in computer vision, we propose to use proportion-support vector machine for characterizing tumors. We also seek the answer to the fundamental question about the goodness of “deep features” for unsupervised tumor classification. We evaluate our proposed supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on two different tumor diagnosis challenges: lung and pancreas with 1018 CT and 171 MRI scans, respectively, and obtain the state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity results in both problems.",2018,50,115,5,True,Computer Science,Medicine,34030794,Sarfaraz Hussein,50712226.0,Pujan Kandel,34458717.0,C.

The risk factor and severity of diabetes can be reduced significantly if the precise early prediction is possible. The robust and accurate prediction of diabetes is highly challenging due to the limited number of labeled data and also the presence of outliers (or missing values) in the diabetes datasets. In this literature, we are proposing a robust framework for diabetes prediction where the outlier rejection, filling the missing values, data standardization, feature selection, K-fold cross-validation, and different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (k-nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were employed. The weighted ensembling of different ML models is also proposed, in this literature, to improve the prediction of diabetes where the weights are estimated from the corresponding Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of the ML model. AUC is chosen as the performance metric, which is then maximized during hyperparameter tuning using the grid search technique. All the experiments, in this literature, were conducted under the same experimental conditions using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. From all the extensive experiments, our proposed ensembling classifier is the best performing classifier with the sensitivity, specificity, false omission rate, diagnostic odds ratio, and AUC as 0.789, 0.934, 0.092, 66.234, and 0.950 respectively which outperforms the state-of-the-art results by 2.00 % in AUC. Our proposed framework for the diabetes prediction outperforms the other methods discussed in the article. It can also provide better results on the same dataset which can lead to better performance in diabetes prediction. Our source code for diabetes prediction is made publicly available.",2020,51,114,9,True,Computer Science,,2078332709,Md. Kamrul Hasan,40143512.0,Md.

Because of the variety of geometry and topology of real-world shapes, previous methods generally use a library of hand-made templates. In this paper, we investigate learning a general shape template from data. To allow for widely varying geometry and topology, we choose an implicit surface representation based on composition of local shape elements. While long known to computer graphics, this representation has not yet been explored in the context of machine learning for vision. We show that structured implicit functions are suitable for learning and allow a network to smoothly and simultaneously fit multiple classes of shapes. The learned shape template supports applications such as shape exploration, correspondence, abstraction, interpolation, and semantic segmentation from an RGB image.",2019,63,237,12,True,Computer Science,,32627314,Kyle Genova,39578349.0,Forrester Cole,1880628.0,Daniel Vlasic,8707513.0,Aaron Sarna,1768236.0,W.

Despite their state-of-the-art performance, these large networks typically do not generalize well to datasets with limited sample sizes. In this paper, we take a different approach by learning multiple layers of kernels. We combine kernels at each layer and then optimize over an estimate of the support vector machine leave-one-out error rather than the dual objective function. Our experiments on a variety of datasets show that each layer successively increases performance with only a few base kernels.",2013,6,49,8,True,Mathematics,Computer Science,38629354,Eric V.

Machine learning techniques make it possible to deduct meaningful further information from those data processed by data mining. Such meaningful and significant information helps organizations to establish their future policies on a sounder basis, and to gain major advantages in terms of time and cost.
