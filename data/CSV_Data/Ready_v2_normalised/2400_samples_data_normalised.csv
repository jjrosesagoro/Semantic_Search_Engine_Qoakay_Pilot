Techniques such as Boosting and Bagging have proven to be highly effective but require repeated resampling of the training data, making them inappropriate in a data mining context. The methods presented in this paper take advantage of plentiful data, building separate classifiers on sequential chunks of training points. These classifiers are combined into a fixed-size ensemble using a heuristic replacement strategy. The result is a fast algorithm for large-scale or streaming data that classifies as well as a single decision tree built on all the data, requires approximately constant memory, and adjusts quickly to concept drift.",2001,21,1184,166,False,Computer Science,2562282,W.

This is a very challenging problem since the direct extension of state-of-the-art white-box attacks (e.g., CW or PGD) to the hard-label black-box setting will require minimizing a non-continuous step function, which is combinatorial and cannot be solved by a gradient-based optimizer. The only current approach is based on random walk on the boundary, which requires lots of queries and lacks convergence guarantees. We propose a novel way to formulate the hard-label black-box attack as a real-valued optimization problem which is usually continuous and can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm. For example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method, we are able to bound the number of iterations needed for our algorithm to achieve stationary points. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous random walk approach to attacking convolutional neural networks on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. More interestingly, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be used to attack other discrete and non-continuous machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).",2018,26,260,32,False,Computer Science,2424698,Minhao Cheng,2067954216.0,Thong Le,153191489.0,Pin-Yu Chen,2882166.0,Jinfeng Yi,49723481.0,Huan Zhang,1793529.0,Cho-Jui Hsieh,,,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach is based on identifying and annotating uncertain samples. The uncertainty value of each sample is measured by its conditional error. The approach takes advantage of current classifiers' probability preserving and ordering properties. It calibrates the output scores of classifiers to conditional error. Thus, it can estimate the uncertainty value for each input sample according to its output score from a classifier and select only samples with uncertainty value above a user-defined threshold. Even though we cannot guarantee the optimality of the proposed approach, we find it to provide good performance. Compared with existing methods, this approach is robust without additional computational effort. A new active learning method for support vector machines (SVMs) is implemented following this approach. A dynamic bin width allocation method is proposed to accurately estimate sample conditional error and this method adapts to the underlying probabilities.

However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods.

Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here, we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states with massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model Hamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states, which paves a novel way to bridge computer science based machine learning techniques to outstanding quantum condensed matter physics problems.",2017,128,271,10,True,Physics,5204254,D.

A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015b) which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately, those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work, we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes. Choosing the domain of movies, we provide tasks that test the ability of models to answer factual questions (utilizing OMDB), provide personalization (utilizing MovieLens), carry short conversations about the two, and finally to perform on natural dialogs from Reddit. We provide a dataset covering 75k movie entities and with 3.5M training examples. We present results of various models on these tasks, and evaluate their performance.",2015,48,177,14,False,Computer Science,34176020,Jesse Dodge,3071104.0,Andreea Gane,2190290316.0,Xiang Zhang,1713934.0,Antoine Bordes,3295092.0,S.

These artificial intelligence systems are being developed to improve medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection, computer-aided classification, and radiogenomics. In August 2018, a meeting was held in Bethesda, Maryland, at the National Institutes of Health to discuss the current state of the art and knowledge gaps and to develop a roadmap for future research initiatives. Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets.

Applying concepts from data science without foreknowledge of their limitations and the unique qualities of materials data, however, could lead to errant conclusions. The differences that exist between various kinds of experimental and calculated data require careful choices of data processing and machine learning methods. Here, we outline potential pitfalls involved in using machine learning without robust protocols. We address some problems of overfitting to training data using decision trees as an example, rational descriptor selection in the field of perovskites, and preserving physical interpretability in the application of dimensionality reducing techniques such as principal component analysis.

We are convinced that machine-learning techniques can help address these problems by performing seismic facies analyses in a rigorous, repeatable way. For this purpose, we use state-of-the-art 3D broadband seismic reflection data of the northern North Sea. Our workflow includes five basic steps. First, we extract seismic attributes to highlight features in the data. Second, we perform a manual seismic facies classification on 10,000 examples. Third, we use some of these examples to train a range of models to predict seismic facies. Fourth, we analyze the performance of these models on the remaining examples. Fifth, we select the “best” model (i.e., highest accuracy) and apply it to a seismic section.

Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.",2014,20,267,22,False,Mathematics,143788219,Pankaj Mehta,40111234.0,D.

In particular, tensor networks (TNs) and deep learning architectures bear striking similarities to the extent that TNs can be used for machine learning. Previous results used one-dimensional TNs in image recognition, showing limited scalability and flexibilities. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve image recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. This approach introduces mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information theory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training phase, TN states are defined, which encode classes of images into quantum many-body states. We study the quantum features of the TN states, including quantum entanglement and fidelity.

We show that by training our model on 3.5 million reactions taken from the collective published knowledge of the entire discipline of chemistry, our model exhibits a top10-accuracy of 95 % in retrosynthesis and 97 % for reaction prediction on a validation set of almost 1 million reactions.",2017,31,281,18,False,Chemistry,3451383,Marwin H.

Additionally, most no-reference or blind approaches are distortion-specific, meaning they assess only a specific type of distortion assumed present in the test image (such as blockiness, blur, or ringing). This limits their application domain. Other approaches rely on training a machine learning algorithm. These methods however, are only as effective as the features used to train their learning machines. Towards ameliorating this we introduce the BLIINDS index (BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics) which is a no-reference approach to image quality assessment that does not assume a specific type of distortion of the image. It is based on predicting image quality based on observing the statistics of local discrete cosine transform coefficients, and it requires only minimal training.

Materials and Methods The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted. Future ML challenges will catalyze collaboration and development of ML tools and methods that can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

An experiment was carried out lasting eight weeks involving PhD students as participants, each of them wearing a Fitbit HR wristband and having their application on their computer recorded during their learning and working activities throughout the day. A software infrastructure for collecting multimodal learning experiences was implemented. As part of this infrastructure a Data Processing Application was developed to pre-process, analyse and generate predictions to provide feedback to the users about their learning performance. Data from different sources were stored using the xAPI standard into a cloud-based Learning Record Store. The participants of the experiment were asked to rate their learning experience through an Activity Rating Tool indicating their perceived level of productivity, stress, challenge and abilities. These self-reported performance indicators were used as markers to train a Linear Mixed Effect Model to generate learner-specific predictions of the learning performance.

However, it is a nontrivial task to train a deep learning model efficiently since the deep learning model often includes a great number of parameters. In this paper, an efficient deep learning model based on the canonical polyadic decomposition is proposed to predict the cloud workload for industry informatics. In the proposed model, the parameters are compressed significantly by converting the weight matrices to the canonical polyadic format. Furthermore, an efficient learning algorithm is designed to train the parameters. Finally, the proposed efficient deep learning model is applied to the workload prediction of virtual machines on cloud. Experiments are conducted on the datasets collected from PlanetLab to validate the performance of the proposed model by comparing with other machine-learning-based approaches for workload prediction of virtual machines. Results indicate that the proposed model achieves a higher training efficiency and workload prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art machine-learning-based approaches, proving the potential of the proposed model to provide predictive services for industry informatics.",2018,29,129,7,False,Computer Science,2108076070,Qingchen Zhang,1690341.0,L.

The software system developed was called VEGA for Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm and was first used on multiple objective optimization problems. The principle conclusion of these experiments was that VEGA provided a powerful and robust search technique for complex multiobjective optimization problems of high order when little or no a priori knowledge was available to guide the search. These results were similar to those found by previous researchers using scalar genetic algorithms for scalar optimization problems. The VEGA technique was then applied to multiclass pattern discrimination tasks. The resulting software system was called LS-2 for Learning System - Two since it followed closely the lead of a scalar-valued learning system called LS-1 developed by Stephen Smith. The experiments revealed that LS-2 was able to evolve high performance production system programs to perform the pattern discrimination tasks it was given. In addition, experiments which varied several of the parameters of LS-2 revealed something of the sensitivity of vector-valued genetic search to the settings of these parameters. In sum it may be said that the VEGA approach has demonstrated the efficacy of extending the previously demonstrated power of genetic algorithms to vector-valued problems and thereby provides a new approach to machine learning.",1984,0,377,37,False,Computer Science,145738991,J.

When learning from highly imbalanced data, most classifiers are overwhelmed by the majority class examples, so the false negative rate is always high. Although researchers have introduced many methods to deal with this problem, including resampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning (CSL), most of them focus on either of these techniques. This study presents two empirical methods that deal with class imbalance using both resampling and CSL. The first method combines and compares several sampling techniques with CSL using support vector machines (SVM). The second method proposes using CSL by optimizing the cost ratio (cost matrix) locally. Our experimental results on 18 imbalanced datasets from the UCI repository show that the first method can reduce the misclassification costs, and the second method can improve the classifier performance.",2010,43,239,7,False,Computer Science,1398807584,Nguyen Thai-Nghe,2382247.0,Zeno Gantner,1388781075.0,L.

Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality, and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach for training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the target language, but also of the source language.

The ability to successfully distinguish between tumor classes (already known or yet to be discovered) using gene expression data is an important aspect of this novel approach to cancer classification.

In this work, we deal with space-invariant non-blind deconvolution. Currently, the most successful methods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step approach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network.

For example, high-proole applications can help to secure funding for future research and can help to attract high caliber students. However, there is another reason why such papers are of value to the eld, which is, arguably, even more vital. Application papers are essential in order for Machine Learning to remain a viable science. They focus research on important unsolved problems that currently restrict the practical applicability of machine learning methods. Much of the \science"" of Machine Learning is a science of engineering. 1 By this we mean that it is dedicated to creating and compiling veriiable knowledge related to the design and construction of artifacts. The scientiic knowledge comprises theoretical arguments, observational categorizations, empirical studies, and practical demonstrations. The artifacts are computer programs that use data to build models that are practically or theoretically useful. Because the objects of study are intended to have practical utility, it is essential for research activities to be focused (in part) on the elimination of obstacles that impede their practical application. Most often these obstacles take the form of restrictive simplifying assumptions commonly made in research. Consider as an example the assumption, common in classiier learning research, that misclassiication errors have equal costs. The vast majority of classiier learning research in Machine Learning has been conducted under this assumption, through the use of classiication accuracy as the primary (or sole) evaluation metric. Is this a reasonable assumption under which we should be operating? The answer is unclear. It is diicult to imagine a real-world classii-cation problem where error costs are equal, and researchers come in from the eld time after time citing problems dealing with unequal misclassiication costs. Nevertheless , we continue to press on with research on increasing classiication accuracy. In the Machine Learning literature isolated studies suggest that it is possible to weaken this assumption and still learn eeectively (Turney 1997), but there have been no comprehensive studies. This is but one small example of a common simplifying assumption that may be too strong. Of course it is not clear that even a very solid applications paper pointing out the inapplicability of this assumption would be suucient to convince the eld to shift its scientiic paradigm (Kuhn 1970).

An implementation, the fault invariant classifier, demonstrates the efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs.

As more data becomes available and more complex problems are tackled, deep machine learning methods may also become useful. Here, we present a brief overview of deep learning methods and show in particular how recursive neural network approaches can be applied to the problem of predicting molecular properties. However, molecules are typically described by undirected cyclic graphs, while recursive approaches typically use directed acyclic graphs. Thus, we develop methods to address this discrepancy, essentially by considering an ensemble of recursive neural networks associated with all possible vertex-centered acyclic orientations of the molecular graph. One advantage of this approach is that it relies only minimally on the identification of suitable molecular descriptors because suitable representations are learned automatically from the data. Several variants of this approach are applied to the problem of predicting aqueous solubility and tested on four benchmark data sets. Experimental results show that the performance of the deep learning methods matches or exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art methods according to several evaluation metrics and expose the fundamental limitations arising from training sets that are too small or too noisy.

Based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, we derive a eigen-decomposition problem which enables the dimensionality reduction process to be efficient. Experiments validate the performance of MDDM.",2008,49,328,40,False,Computer Science,2108506794,Yin Zhang,145624000.0,Zhi-Hua Zhou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.",2018,76,207,11,True,Computer Science,2083807,B.

This contrasts with passive learning, where the labeled data are taken at random. The objective in active learning is to produce a highly-accurate classifier, ideally using fewer labels than the number of random labeled data sufficient for passive learning to achieve the same. This article describes recent advances in our understanding of the theoretical benefits of active learning, and implications for the design of effective active learning algorithms. Much of the article focuses on a particular technique, namely disagreement-based active learning, which by now has amassed a mature and coherent literature. It also briefly surveys several alternative approaches from the literature. The emphasis is on theorems regarding the performance of a few general algorithms, including rigorous proofs where appropriate. However, the presentation is intended to be pedagogical, focusing on results that illustrate fundamental ideas, rather than obtaining the strongest or most general known theorems. The intended audience includes researchers and advanced graduate students in machine learning and statistics, interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the recent and ongoing developments in the theory of active learning.",2014,86,202,19,False,Computer Science,1762565,Steve Hanneke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies have demonstrated that such adversarial examples are not very effective in the physical world--they either completely fail to cause misclassification or only work in restricted cases where a relatively complex image is perturbed and printed on paper. In this paper we propose a new attack algorithm--Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2)-- that generates perturbations by taking images under different conditions into account. Our algorithm can create spatially-constrained perturbations that mimic vandalism or art to reduce the likelihood of detection by a casual observer. We show that adversarial examples generated by RP2 achieve high success rates under various conditions for real road sign recognition by using an evaluation methodology that captures physical world conditions. We physically realized and evaluated two attacks, one that causes a Stop sign to be misclassified as a Speed Limit sign in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a Right Turn sign to be misclassified as either a Stop or Added Lane sign in 100% of the testing conditions.",2017,22,263,20,False,Computer Science,22229139,I.
