Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field. Radiologists should become familiar with the principles and potential applications of deep learning in medical imaging. ©RSNA, 2017.",2017,28,583,14,True,Medicine,38162399,G. Chartrand,34842677.0,P.

Due to the heterogeneity of the client datasets, standard federated optimization methods such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) are often difficult to tune and exhibit unfavorable convergence behavior. In non-federated settings, adaptive optimization methods have had notable success in combating such issues. In this work, we propose federated versions of adaptive optimizers, including Adagrad, Adam, and Yogi, and analyze their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous data for general nonconvex settings. Our results highlight the interplay between client heterogeneity and communication efficiency. We also perform extensive experiments on these methods and show that the use of adaptive optimizers can significantly improve the performance of federated learning.",2020,52,464,123,False,Computer Science,1981186,Sashank J.

Labeled instances however are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there has been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice. We present a series of novel semi-supervised learning approaches arising from a graph representation, where labeled and unlabeled instances are represented as vertices, and edges encode the similarity between instances. They address the following questions: How to use unlabeled data? (label propagation); What is the probabilistic interpretation? (Gaussian fields and harmonic functions); What if we can choose labeled data? (active learning); How to construct good graphs? (hyperparameter learning); How to work with kernel machines like SVM?

Different from the common understanding and tenet that hidden neurons of neural networks need to be iteratively adjusted during training stage, ELM theories show that hidden neurons are important but need not be iteratively tuned. In fact, all the parameters of hidden nodes can be independent of training samples and randomly generated according to any continuous probability distribution. And the obtained ELM networks satisfy universal approximation and classification capability. The fully connected ELM architecture has been extensively studied. However, ELM with local connections has not attracted much research attention yet. This paper studies the general architecture of locally connected ELM, showing that: 1) ELM theories are naturally valid for local connections, thus introducing local receptive fields to the input layer; 2) each hidden node in ELM can be a combination of several hidden nodes (a subnetwork), which is also consistent with ELM theories. ELM theories may shed a light on the research of different local receptive fields including true biological receptive fields of which the exact shapes and formula may be unknown to human beings. As a specific example of such general architectures, random convolutional nodes and a pooling structure are implemented in this paper. Experimental results on the NORB dataset, a benchmark for object recognition, show that compared with conventional deep learning solutions, the proposed local receptive fields based ELM (ELM-LRF) reduces the error rate from 6.5% to 2.7% and increases the learning speed up to 200 times.",2015,70,300,32,False,Computer Science,145678691,G.

The relative ease and availability of fingerprint type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis, and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6 fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohen's kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM, which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods. Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.",2017,115,197,0,True,Computer Science,46927010,A.

Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA's standard distribution, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection and hyperparameter optimization methods.

A constant sfream of data bombards our senses and millions of sensory channels carry information into our brains. Brains are also learning machines that condition, combine, parse, and store data. Is it possible to learn something about learning by observing the style of computation used by brains? This is the motivation for research into computational devices that today are called ""neural networks."" Neural networks are nonlinear dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom that can be used to solve computational problems. The mathematical foundations for learning in this class of machines was laid by agroup of researchers in the 1940s and 1950s. The achievement documented in this book is the thorough study of one of the simplest members of this class, feedforward networks with one layer of m w ~ a b l e weights connecting input units to output units. In a sense, these might be called reflex machines. The knee-jerk reflex, for example, is mediated by synaptic connections from the sensory recepton in your knee directly onto rnotoneurons in your spinal cord that in turn activate leg muscles. There are limits to how much computation can be accomplished by such reflexes, and these limits have been carefully delineated in this book. Just as more complex creatures evolved by layering control loops on the primitive reflexes, network models have also evolved in recent years and now have achieved vastly greater capabilities than reflex machines by making use of multilayered architectures with feedback connections. Nonetheless, recent work could not have been accomplished without building on these foundations. vii viil INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION ix Despite the early promise of research on neural networks, there was a period of about 20 years, from the mid 1960s to the mid 1980s. when interest in neural networks as computational devices and models of human behavior waned in favor of models based on symbol processing. There are many reasons for this, some of them now evident in this book. Still, Learning Machines was an underground classic among the neural network modelers who were active during this ""dark age"" and deserves to be better known to the generation that is ""relearning"" what was once known about statistical learning machines.

ELM is a new kind of single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with an extremely low computational cost. ELM, however, has two evident drawbacks: 1) the output weights solved by Moore-Penrose generalized inverse is a least squares minimization issue, which easily suffers from overfitting and 2) the accuracy of ELM is drastically sensitive to the number of hidden neurons so that a large model is usually generated. This brief presents a sparse Bayesian approach for learning the output weights of ELM in classification. The new model, called Sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM), can resolve these two drawbacks by estimating the marginal likelihood of network outputs and automatically pruning most of the redundant hidden neurons during learning phase, which results in an accurate and compact model.

Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks.",2011,28,4433,1682,False,Computer Science,34180232,Yuval Netzer,2156632012.0,Tao Wang,144638694.0,Adam Coates,1726358.0,A.

Its successful use in the winning system of last year's Pascal image classification Challenge (Everingham, 2009) shows that the ability to integrate geometric information is critical for some real world machine learning applications. This paper further develops the idea of integrating geometry in machine learning by extending the original LCC method to include local tangent directions. These new correction terms lead to better approximation of high dimensional nonlinear functions when the underlying data manifold is locally relatively flat. The method significantly reduces the number of anchor points needed in LCC, which not only reduces computational cost, but also improves prediction performance. Experiments are included to demonstrate that this method is more effective than the original LCC method on some image classification tasks.",2010,16,163,22,False,Computer Science,144782042,Kai Yu,49104973.0,Tong Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assumption may not hold in cost-sensitive recognition tasks, such as face recognition-based access control system, where misclassifying a stranger as a family member may result in more serious disaster than misclassifying a family member as a stranger. Though recent cost-sensitive learning can reduce the total loss with a given cost matrix that quantifies how severe one type of mistake against another, in many realistic cases, the cost matrix is unknown to users. Motivated by these concerns, this paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive ELM, with the following merits: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first proposal of ELM in evolutionary cost-sensitive classification scenario; 2) it well addresses the open issue of how to define the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks; and 3) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is induced for adaptive cost matrix optimization.

As a primary defense of network infrastructure, an intrusion detection system is expected to adapt to dynamically changing threat landscape. Many supervised and unsupervised techniques have been devised by researchers from the discipline of machine learning and data mining to achieve reliable detection of anomalies. Deep learning is an area of machine learning which applies neuron-like structure for learning tasks. Deep learning has profoundly changed the way we approach learning tasks by delivering monumental progress in different disciplines like speech processing, computer vision, and natural language processing to name a few. It is only relevant that this new technology must be investigated for information security applications. The aim of this paper is to investigate the suitability of deep learning approaches for anomaly-based intrusion detection system. For this research, we developed anomaly detection models based on different deep neural network structures, including convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and recurrent neural networks. These deep models were trained on NSLKDD training data set and evaluated on both test data sets provided by NSLKDD, namely NSLKDDTest+ and NSLKDDTest21. All experiments in this paper are performed by authors on a GPU-based test bed. Conventional machine learning-based intrusion detection models were implemented using well-known classification techniques, including extreme learning machine, nearest neighbor, decision-tree, random-forest, support vector machine, naive-bays, and quadratic discriminant analysis. Both deep and conventional machine learning models were evaluated using well-known classification metrics, including receiver operating characteristics, area under curve, precision-recall curve, mean average precision and accuracy of classification.

However, since the kernels are indefinite, we can no longer minimize the loss, instead we stabilize it. We show a general representer theorem for constrained stabilization and prove generalization bounds by computing the Rademacher averages of the kernel class.

We propose a kernel classifier that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a “difference of densities”. We focus on the Gaussian kernel, although the method applies to other kernels suitable for density estimation. Like a support vector machine (SVM), the classifier is sparse and results from solving a quadratic program. We provide statistical performance guarantees for the proposed L2 kernel classifier in the form of a finite sample oracle inequality, and strong consistency in the sense of both ISE and probability of error. A special case of our analysis applies to a previously introduced ISE-based method for kernel density estimation. For dimensionality greater than 15, the basic L2 kernel classifier performs poorly in practice. Thus, we extend the method through the introduction of a natural regularization parameter, which allows it to remain competitive with the SVM in high dimensions.

Results from a case study deployment and a randomized experiment demonstrate that AXIS elicits and identifies explanations that learners find helpful.

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.",2005,34,5238,741,False,Mathematics,7446832,Kilian Q. Weinberger,1796044.0,L.

Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed.

For example, overall performance of a cancer detection model may be high, but the model may still consistently miss a rare but aggressive cancer subtype. We refer to this problem as hidden stratification, and observe that it results from incompletely describing the meaningful variation in a dataset. While hidden stratification can substantially reduce the clinical efficacy of machine learning models, its effects remain difficult to measure. In this work, we assess the utility of several possible techniques for measuring hidden stratification effects, and characterize these effects both via synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-100 benchmark dataset and on multiple real-world medical imaging datasets. Using these measurement techniques, we find evidence that hidden stratification can occur in unidentified imaging subsets with low prevalence, low label quality, subtle distinguishing features, or spurious correlates, and that it can result in relative performance differences of over 20% on clinically important subsets. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of our findings, and suggest that evaluation of hidden stratification should be a critical component of any machine learning deployment in medical imaging.",2019,60,188,9,False,Computer Science,1404268029,L.

We formulate MC detection as a supervised-learning problem and apply SVM to develop the detection algorithm. We use the SVM to detect at each location in the image whether an MC is present or not. We tested the proposed method using a database of 76 clinical mammograms containing 1120 MCs. We use free-response receiver operating characteristic curves to evaluate detection performance, and compare the proposed algorithm with several existing methods. In our experiments, the proposed SVM framework outperformed all the other methods tested. In particular, a sensitivity as high as 94% was achieved by the SVM method at an error rate of one false-positive cluster per image.

We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server.

In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral data make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional machine learning methods.

In recent years, deep learning has been recognized as a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems and widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those successful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares several strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main challenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework that divides the corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks, and spectral–spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition, considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing field are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large number of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification performance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this topic.

However, developing and selecting accurate time series models is a challenging task as this requires training several different models for selecting the best amongst them along with substantial feature engineering to derive informative features and finding optimal time lags, a commonly used input features for time series models. Methods: Our approach uses machine learning and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with various configurations to construct forecasting models for short to medium term aggregate load forecasting. The research solves above mentioned problems by training several linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms and picking the best as baseline, choosing best features using wrapper and embedded feature selection methods and finally using genetic algorithm (GA) to find optimal time lags and number of layers for LSTM model predictive performance optimization. Results: Using France metropolitan’s electricity consumption data as a case study, obtained results show that LSTM based model has shown high accuracy then machine learning model that is optimized with hyperparameter tuning. Using the best features, optimal lags, layers and training various LSTM configurations further improved forecasting accuracy. Conclusions: A LSTM model using only optimally selected time lagged features captured all the characteristics of complex time series and showed decreased Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for medium to long range forecasting for a wider metropolitan area.",2018,51,384,11,True,Computer Science,2840057,S.

The classical ELM model consists of a linear combination of a fixed number of nonlinear expansions of the input vector. Learning in ELM is hence equivalent to finding the optimal weights that minimize the error on a dataset. The update works in batch mode, either with explicit feature mappings or with implicit mappings defined by kernels. Although an online version has been proposed for the former, no work has been done up to this point for the latter, and whether an efficient learning algorithm for online kernel-based ELM exists remains an open problem. By explicating some connections between nonlinear adaptive filtering and ELM theory, in this brief, we present an algorithm for this task. In particular, we propose a straightforward extension of the well-known kernel recursive least-squares, belonging to the kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) family, to the ELM framework. We call the resulting algorithm the kernel online sequential ELM (KOS-ELM). Moreover, we consider two different criteria used in the KAF field to obtain sparse filters and extend them to our context. We show that KOS-ELM, with their integration, can result in a highly efficient algorithm, both in terms of obtained generalization error and training time.

This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. Methods We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words’ semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. Results ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. Conclusion It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets.",2015,79,488,42,True,Medicine,1902199,Azadeh Nikfarjam,48673524.0,A.
