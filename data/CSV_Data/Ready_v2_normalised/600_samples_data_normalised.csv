Statistics has always been interdisciplinary, borrowing ideas from diverse  elds and repaying the debt with contributions, both theoretical and practical, to the other intellectual disciplines. For statistical learning, this cross-fertilization is especially noticeable. This book is a valuable resource, both for the statistician needing an introduction to machine learning and related  elds and for the computer scientist wishing to learn more about statistics. Statisticians will especially appreciate that it is written in their own language. The level of the book is roughly that of a second-year doctoral student in statistics, and it will be useful as a textbook for such students. In a stimulating article, Breiman (2001) argued that statistics has been focused too much on a “data modeling culture,” where the model is paramount. Breiman argued instead for an “algorithmic modeling culture,” with emphasis on black-box types of prediction. Breiman’s article is controversial, and in his discussion, Efron objects that “prediction is certainly an interesting subject, but Leo’s paper overstates both its role and our profession’s lack of interest in it.” Although I mostly agree with Efron, I worry that the courses offered by most statistics departments include little, if any, treatment of statistical learning and prediction. (Stanford, where Efron and the authors of this book teach, is an exception.) Graduate students in statistics certainly need to know more than they do now about prediction, machine learning, statistical learning, and data mining (not disjoint subjects). I hope that graduate courses covering the topics of this book will become more common in statistics curricula. Most of the book is focused on supervised learning, where one has inputs and outputs from some system and wishes to predict unknown outputs corresponding to known inputs. The methods discussed for supervised learning include linear and logistic regression; basis expansion, such as splines and wavelets; kernel techniques, such as local regression, local likelihood, and radial basis functions; neural networks; additive models; decision trees based on recursive partitioning, such as CART; and support vector machines. There is a  nal chapter on unsupervised learning, including association rules, cluster analysis, self-organizing maps, principal components and curves, and independent component analysis. Many statisticians will be unfamiliar with at least some of these algorithms. Association rules are popular for mining commercial data in what is called “market basket analysis.” The aim is to discover types of products often purchased together. Such knowledge can be used to develop marketing strategies, such as store or catalog layouts. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) involve essentially constrained k-means clustering, where prototypes are mapped to a two-dimensional curved coordinate system. Independent components analysis is similar to principal components analysis and factor analysis, but it uses higher-order moments to achieve independence, not merely zero correlation between components. A strength of the book is the attempt to organize a plethora of methods into a coherent whole. The relationships among the methods are emphasized. I know of no other book that covers so much ground. Of course, with such broad coverage, it is not possible to cover any single topic in great depth, so this book will encourage further reading. Fortunately, each chapter includes bibliographic notes surveying the recent literature. These notes and the extensive references provide a good introduction to the learning literature, including much outside of statistics. The book might be more suitable as a textbook if less material were covered in greater depth; however, such a change would compromise the book’s usefulness as a reference, and so I am happier with the book as it was written.",2004,2,15322,1843,False,Mathematics,144108246,D.

However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01–0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers. Finally, we propose a highly scalable and hybrid DNNs framework called scale-hybrid-IDS-AlertNet which can be used in real-time to effectively monitor the network traffic and host-level events to proactively alert possible cyberattacks.",2019,85,546,24,True,Computer Science,51162051,R.

Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time.

As a result, machine learning is frequently used in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently machine learning has been applied to cancer prognosis and prediction. This latter approach is particularly interesting as it is part of a growing trend towards personalized, predictive medicine. In assembling this review we conducted a broad survey of the different types of machine learning methods being used, the types of data being integrated and the performance of these methods in cancer prediction and prognosis.

We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem.

Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches.

Recently, a simple and efficient learning method, referred to as extreme learning machine (ELM), was proposed by Huang , which has shown that, compared to some conventional methods, the training time of neural networks can be reduced by a thousand times. However, one of the open problems in ELM research is whether the number of hidden nodes can be further reduced without affecting learning effectiveness. This brief proposes a new learning algorithm, called bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM), in which some hidden nodes are not randomly selected. In theory, this algorithm tends to reduce network output error to 0 at an extremely early learning stage. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the network output error and the network output weights in the proposed B-ELM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can be tens to hundreds of times faster than other incremental ELM algorithms.",2012,14,162,6,False,Computer Science,2108776795,Yimin Yang,2119048509.0,Yaonan Wang,2474758.0,Xiaofang Yuan,,,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This contrasts with classical approaches to artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have downplayed learning from interaction, focusing instead on learning from a knowledgeable teacher, or on reasoning from a complete model of the environment. Modern reinforcement learning research is highly interdisciplinary; it includes researchers specializing in operations research, genetic algorithms, neural networks, psychology, and control engineering. Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a scalar reward signal. The learner is not told which action to take, as in most forms of machine learning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward, but also the next situation, and through that all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics—trial-and-error search and delayed reward—are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning. One of the challenges that arises in reinforcement learning and not in other kinds of learning is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. To obtain a lot of reward, a reinforcement learning agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective in producing reward. But to discover which actions these are it has to select actions that it has not tried before. The agent has to exploit what it already knows in order to obtain reward, but it also has to explore in order to make better action selections in the future. The dilemma is that neither exploitation nor exploration can be pursued exclusively without failing at the task.

With this ability, new class labels could be assigned to these inputs by a human operator, allowing them to be incorporated into the recognition function—ideally under an efficient incremental update mechanism. While good algorithms that assume inputs from a fixed set of classes exist, e.g. , artificial neural networks and kernel machines, it is not immediately obvious how to extend them to perform incremental learning in the presence of unknown query classes. Existing algorithms take little to no distributional information into account when learning recognition functions and lack a strong theoretical foundation. We address this gap by formulating a novel, theoretically sound classifier—the Extreme Value Machine (EVM). The EVM has a well-grounded interpretation derived from statistical Extreme Value Theory (EVT), and is the first classifier to be able to perform nonlinear kernel-free variable bandwidth incremental learning.

These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machine learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.",2008,110,563,35,True,Computer Science,2008387,J.

'Data Mining' can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black-box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those where data mining techniques directly resulted in improved science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, petascale computing, and the time domain.

Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field. Radiologists should become familiar with the principles and potential applications of deep learning in medical imaging. ©RSNA, 2017.",2017,28,583,14,True,Medicine,38162399,G. Chartrand,34842677.0,P.

Understanding training-set attacks is important as more intelligent agents (e.g. spam filters and robots) are equipped with learning capability and can potentially be hacked via data they receive from the environment. This paper identifies the optimal training-set attack on a broad family of machine learners. First we show that optimal training-set attack can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. Then we show that for machine learners with certain Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions we can solve the bilevel problem efficiently using gradient methods on an implicit function.

Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multiobjective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly due to the great success of multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multiobjective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost function in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. One common benefit of the different multiobjective learning approaches is that a deeper insight into the learning problem can be gained by analyzing the Pareto front composed of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper provides an overview of the existing research on multiobjective machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multiobjective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail.

By sampling from the conditional distributions over each data modality, it is possible to create these representations even when some data modalities are missing. We conduct experiments on bimodal image-text and audio-video data.

A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically find such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy.",2001,28,901,68,False,Computer Science,3030274,A.

However, due to the limited availability of human labeled training data, training data that stay in the same feature space or have the same distribution as the future data cannot be guaranteed to be sufficient enough to avoid the over-fitting problem. In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks.

Despite extensive research efforts for decades, it remains one of the most challenging open problems that considerably hinders the successes of real-world CBIR systems. The key challenge has been attributed to the well-known ``semantic gap'' issue that exists between low-level image pixels captured by machines and high-level semantic concepts perceived by human. Among various techniques, machine learning has been actively investigated as a possible direction to bridge the semantic gap in the long term. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and other applications, in this paper, we attempt to address an open problem: if deep learning is a hope for bridging the semantic gap in CBIR and how much improvements in CBIR tasks can be achieved by exploring the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for learning feature representations and similarity measures. Specifically, we investigate a framework of deep learning with application to CBIR tasks with an extensive set of empirical studies by examining a state-of-the-art deep learning method (Convolutional Neural Networks) for CBIR tasks under varied settings.

For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult.

In this paper, I address this by exploring a politics of learning through two key sites: first, tactical learning; second, urban learning forums. I offer a conception of learning based on three processes: translation , or the relational distributions through which learning is produced as a sociomaterial epistemology of displacement and change; coordination , or the construction of functional systems that enable learning as a means of linking different forms of knowledge, coping with complexity and facilitating adaptation; and dwelling , or the education of attention through which learning operates as a way of seeing and inhabiting the world. I then consider this conception of learning in relation to tactical learning, i.e. the resources marginal groups use to cope with, negotiate and resist in the city, and urban learning forums, i.e. the possibilities for progressive forms of learning between different constituencies in the city.

Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data. The history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique [1] for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences [2] employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) [3] and neocognitron [4] were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data. This tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed. Finally, a section reviews methods and examples as implemented in the open source data analysis and visualization language R (http://www.r-project.org).",2007,50,482,19,True,Computer Science,2490889,A.

We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis. We also explored feature selection techniques, including the use of AdaBoost for feature selection prior to classification by SVM or LDA. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost followed by classification with support vector machines. The system operates in real-time, and obtained 93% correct generalization to novel subjects for a 7-way forced choice on the Cohn-Kanade expression dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics. We applied the system to to fully automated recognition of facial actions (FACS). The present system classifies 17 action units, whether they occur singly or in combination with other actions, with a mean accuracy of 94.8%. We present preliminary results for applying this system to spontaneous facial expressions.",2005,18,701,56,False,Computer Science,2218905,M. Bartlett,46548046.0,G. Littlewort,145595070.0,M.
