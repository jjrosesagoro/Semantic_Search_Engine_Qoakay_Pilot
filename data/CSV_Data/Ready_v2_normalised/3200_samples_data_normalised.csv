In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often refereed to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of hitherto attempts at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.",2019,86,61,9,False,Computer Science,1691955,E.

Our scheme uses a server-managed challenge/response pair (CRP) lockdown protocol: unlike prior approaches, an adaptive chosen-challenge adversary with machine learning capabilities cannot obtain new CRPs without the server's implicit permission. The adversary is faced with the problem of deriving a PUF model with a limited amount of machine learning training data. Our system-level approach allows a so-called strong PUF to be used for lightweight authentication in a manner that is heuristically secure against today's best machine learning methods through a worst-case CRP exposure algorithmic validation. We also present a degenerate instantiation using a weak PUF that is secure against computationally unrestricted adversaries, which includes any learning adversary, for practical device lifetimes and read-out rates. We validate our approach using silicon PUF data, and demonstrate the feasibility of supporting 10, 1,000, and 1M authentications, including practical configurations that are not learnable with polynomial resources, e.g., the number of CRPs and the attack runtime, using recent results based on the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) complexity-theoretic framework.",2016,41,141,25,True,Computer Science,2888811,M.

However, creating comprehensive label guidelines for crowdworkers is often prohibitive even for seemingly simple concepts. Incomplete or ambiguous label guidelines can then result in differing interpretations of concepts and inconsistent labels. Existing approaches for improving label quality, such as worker screening or detection of poor work, are ineffective for this problem and can lead to rejection of honest work and a missed opportunity to capture rich interpretations about data. We introduce Revolt, a collaborative approach that brings ideas from expert annotation workflows to crowd-based labeling. Revolt eliminates the burden of creating detailed label guidelines by harnessing crowd disagreements to identify ambiguous concepts and create rich structures (groups of semantically related items) for post-hoc label decisions. Experiments comparing Revolt to traditional crowdsourced labeling show that Revolt produces high quality labels without requiring label guidelines in turn for an increase in monetary cost. This up front cost, however, is mitigated by Revolt's ability to produce reusable structures that can accommodate a variety of label boundaries without requiring new data to be collected. Further comparisons of Revolt's collaborative and non-collaborative variants show that collaboration reaches higher label accuracy with lower monetary cost.",2017,61,170,10,False,Computer Science,48808806,Joseph Chee Chang,1719124.0,Saleema Amershi,1783184.0,Ece Kamar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this mathematical classicism, the implementation of efficient SVM solvers has diverged from the classical methods of numerical optimization.

These algorithms compare an unseen protein sequence with all the identified protein sequences and returned the higher scored protein sequences. As the sizes of the protein sequence databases are very large, it is a very time consuming job to perform exhaustive comparison of existing protein sequence. Therefore, there is a need to build an improved classification system for effectively identifying protein sequences. In this paper, a recently developed machine learning algorithm referred to as the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to classify protein sequences with ten classes of super-families downloaded from a public domain database. A comparative study on system performance is conducted between ELM and the main conventional neural network classifier - backpropagation neural networks. Results show that ELM needs up to four orders of magnitude less training time compared to BP Network. The classification accuracy of ELM is also higher than that of BP network. For given network architecture, ELM does not have any control parameters (i.e, stopping criteria, learning rate, learning epoches, etc.) to be manually tuned and can be implemented easily.",2005,13,102,11,False,Computer Science,49371187,Dianhui Wang,145678691.0,G.

Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing interest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization performance (the ""virtual support vector"" method) does so by incorporating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the ""reduced set"" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision surface. We apply this method to achieve a factor of fifty speedup in test phase over the virtual support vector machine. The combined approach yields a machine which is both 22 times faster than the original machine, and which has better generalization performance, achieving 1.1 % error. The virtual support vector method is applicable to any SVM problem with known invariances.

Their underlying processes are typically black-boxed to increase ease-of-use. Consequently, children lack the opportunity to explore such processes and develop essential mental models. We present a gesture recognition research platform, designed to support learning from experience by uncovering Machine Learning building blocks: Data Labeling and Evaluation. Children used the platform to perform physical gestures, iterating between sampling and evaluation. Their understanding was tested in a pre/post experimental design, in three conditions: learning activity uncovering Data Labeling only, Evaluation only, or both. Our findings show that both building blocks are imperative to enhance children's understanding of basic Machine Learning concepts.

To address the challenge for automated taxonomic identification of images generated by our customâbuilt submersible Imaging FlowCytobot, we developed an approach that relies on extraction of image features, which are then presented to a machine learning algorithm for classification. Our approach uses a combination of image feature types including size, shape, symmetry, and texture characteristics, plus orientation invariant moments, diffraction pattern sampling, and coâoccurrence matrix statistics. Some of these features required preprocessing with image analysis techniques including edge detection after phase congruency calculations, morphological operations, boundary representation and simplification, and rotation. For the machine learning strategy, we developed an approach that combines a feature selection algorithm and use of a support vector machine specified with a rigorous parameter selection and training approach. After training, a 22âcategory classifier provides 88% overall accuracy for an independent test set, with individual category accuracies ranging from 68% to 99%. We demonstrate application of this classifier to a nearly uninterrupted 2âmonth time series of images acquired in Woods Hole Harbor, including use of statistical error correction to derive quantitative concentration estimates, which are shown to be unbiased with respect to manual estimates for random subsamples.

In this paper, we propose an asynchronous ADMM algorithm by using two conditions to control the asynchrony: partial barrier and bounded delay.

This paper develops a constraint-agnostic solution for computing explanations for any ML model. The proposed solution exploits abductive reasoning, and imposes the requirement that the ML model can be represented as sets of constraints using some target constraint reasoning system for which the decision problem can be answered with some oracle.

Now, automated image analysis can effectively score many phenotypes. In practical application, customizing an image-analysis algorithm or finding a sufficient number of example cells to train a machine learning algorithm can be infeasible, particularly when positive control samples are not available and the phenotype of interest is rare. Here we present a supervised machine learning approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput, image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i.e., classifier) to recognize cells with a phenotype of interest during a short, interactive training session using iterative feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the presence of cells displaying the phenotype. By using this approach, we successfully scored images in RNA interference screens in 2 organisms for the prevalence of 15 diverse cellular morphologies, some of which were previously intractable.",2009,40,372,11,True,Computer Science,2646100,T.

This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning methods-that are geared toward classification and coarse-graining of molecular simulations-seen in relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques. It discusses the importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures as the starting point of the analyses and highlights the risk of introducing preconceived biases when using machine learning to rationalize and understand structure-property relations. Supervised machine-learning techniques that explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material given its structure are less susceptible to such biases. Current developments in the field suggest that using these two classes of approaches side-by-side and in a fully integrated mode, while keeping in mind the relations between the data analysis framework and the fundamental physical principles, will be key to realizing the full potential of machine learning to help understand the behavior of complex molecules and materials.",2019,111,83,1,True,Computer Science,1917770,M.

These utterancelevel features are then fed into an extreme learning machine (ELM), a special simple and efficient single-hidden-layer neural network, to identify utterance-level emotions.

Due to the widespread adoption of such devices, their diversity, standardization obstacles, and inherent mobility, organizations require an intelligent mechanism capable of automatically detecting suspicious IoT devices connected to their networks. In particular, devices not included in a white list of trustworthy IoT device types (allowed to be used within the organizational premises) should be detected. In this research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied to features extracted from network traffic data with the aim of accurately identifying IoT device types from the white list. To train and evaluate multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data from 17 distinct IoT devices, representing nine types of IoT devices. Based on the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, IoT device types that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown in 96% of test cases (on average), and white listed device types were correctly classified by their actual types in 99% of cases. Some IoT device types were identified quicker than others (e.g., sockets and thermostats were successfully detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect detection of unauthorized IoT device types was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99.49% accuracy. Further experiments demonstrated the successful applicability of classifiers trained in one location and tested on another.

We find that quantified principal components from PCA not only allow the exploration of different phases and symmetry-breaking, but they can distinguish phase-transition types and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors have a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the frustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point to incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of the BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo analysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase transition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the ""charge"" correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin configurations points to some of the limitations of PCA.

Our algorithm for learning the structure and parameters of an RPT searches over a space of relational features that use aggregation functions (e.g. AVERAGE, MODE, COUNT) to dynamically propositionalize relational data and create binary splits within the RPT. Previous work has identified a number of statistical biases due to characteristics of relational data such as autocorrelation and degree disparity. The RPT algorithm uses a novel form of randomization test to adjust for these biases.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have been of special interest, since they can be applied in several steps of the drug discovery methodology, such as prediction of target structure, prediction of biological activity of new ligands through model construction, discovery or optimization of hits, and construction of models that predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological (ADMET) profile of compounds. Areas covered: This article presents an overview on some applications of ML techniques in drug design. These techniques can be employed in ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) studies, such as similarity searches, construction of classification and/or prediction models of biological activity, prediction of secondary structures and binding sites docking and virtual screening. Expert opinion: Successful cases have been reported in the literature, demonstrating the efficiency of ML techniques combined with traditional approaches to study medicinal chemistry problems. Some ML techniques used in drug design are: support vector machine, random forest, decision trees and artificial neural networks. Currently, an important application of ML techniques is related to the calculation of scoring functions used in docking and virtual screening assays from a consensus, combining traditional and ML techniques in order to improve the prediction of binding sites and docking solutions.",2016,184,160,5,False,Computer Science,46480421,AngÃ©lica Nakagawa Lima,2335673.0,E.

Kernelized reinforcement learning techniques are fairly new and different authors have approached the topic with different assumptions and goals. Neither a unifying view nor an understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches has yet emerged. In this paper, we offer a unifying view of the different approaches to kernelized value function approximation for reinforcement learning. We show that, except for different approaches to regularization, Kernelized LSTD (KLSTD) is equivalent to a modelbased approach that uses kernelized regression to find an approximate reward and transition model, and that Gaussian Process Temporal Difference learning (GPTD) returns a mean value function that is equivalent to these other approaches. We also discuss the relationship between our modelbased approach and the earlier Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning (GPRL). Finally, we decompose the Bellman error into the sum of transition error and reward error terms, and demonstrate through experiments that this decomposition can be helpful in choosing regularization parameters.",2009,16,117,9,False,Mathematics,2189083,Gavin Taylor,145726861.0,Ronald E.

The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark.

The goal of data-driven decision-making is to learn a decision from finitely many training samples that will perform well on unseen test samples. This learning task is difficult even if all training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution---especially if the dimension of the uncertainty is large relative to the training sample size. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization seeks data-driven decisions that perform well under the most adverse distribution within a certain Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution constructed from the training samples. In this tutorial we will argue that this approach has many conceptual and computational benefits. Most prominently, the optimal decisions can often be computed by solving tractable convex optimization problems, and they enjoy rigorous out-of-sample and asymptotic consistency guarantees.

Various fairness formalizations, with no firm consensus yet, are employed to prevent such algorithms from systematically discriminating against people based on certain attributes protected by law.

We provide theoretical as well as empirical critiques of these notions from the social sciences literature and explain how these critiques limit the suitability of the corresponding fairness formalizations to certain domains.

A novel regression technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this study. SVM is based on the principle of Structural Risk Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization espoused by conventional regression techniques. The flood data at Dhaka, Bangladesh, are used in this study to demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of SVM. The result is compared with that of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model for oneâlead day to sevenâlead day forecasting. The improvements in maximum predicted water level errors by SVM over ANN for fourâlead day to sevenâlead day are 9.6 cm, 22.6 cm, 4.9 cm and 15.7 cm, respectively. The result shows that the prediction accuracy of SVM is at least as good as and in some cases (particularly at higher lead days) actually better than that of ANN, yet it offers advantages over many of the limitations of ANN, for example in arriving at ANN's optimal network architecture and choosing useful training set.

Since the applicability of these simulation techniques is limited by the costs of the underlying electronic structure calculations, we develop and assess different machine learning models for this task. The machine learning models are trained on ab initio calculations for excited electronic states, using the methylenimmonium cation (CH2NH 2+ ) as a model system. Two distinct strategies for modeling excited state properties are tested in this work. The first strategy is to treat each state separately in a kernel ridge regression model and all states together in a multiclass neural network. The second strategy is to instead encode the state as input into the model, which is tested with both models. Numerical evidence suggests that using the state as input yields the best performance. An important goal for excited-state machine learning models is their use in dynamics simulations, which needs not only state-specific information but also couplings, i.e. properties involving pairs of states. Accordingly, we investigate how well machine learning models can predict the couplings. Furthermore, we explore how combining all properties in a single neural network affects the accuracy. Finally, machine learning predicted energies, forces, and couplings are used to carry out excited-state dynamics simulations.

In the last few years, deep learning has advanced radically in such a way that it can surpass human-level performance on a number of tasks. As a consequence, deep learning is being extensively used in most of the recent day-to-day applications. However, security of deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify the output. In recent times, different types of adversaries based on their threat model leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise a deep learning system where adversaries have high incentives. Hence, it is extremely important to provide robustness to deep learning algorithms against these adversaries. However, there are only a few strong countermeasures which can be used in all types of attack scenarios to design a robust deep learning system.

Neural networks consist of a collection of interconnected processors that compute in parallel. The parallelism allows the network to examine various constraints simultaneously during the learning phase and enables reductions in computing time that are attractive in real-time applications. The learning abilities of these networks in a tuning operation are discussed. The network learns by observing the effect of the input variables of the operation (such as feed rate, depth of cut, and cutting speed) on the output variables (such as cutting force, power, temperature, and surface finish of the workpiece). The learning phase is followed by a synthesis phase during which the network predicts the input conditions to be used by the machine tool to maximize the metal removal rate subject to appropriate operating constraints. >",1989,15,193,2,False,Computer Science,2499016,S.

Researchers have proven that the target-side monolingual data can greatly enhance the decoder model of NMT. However, the source-side monolingual data is not fully explored although it should be useful to strengthen the encoder model of NMT, especially when the parallel corpus is far from sufficient. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make full use of the sourceside monolingual data in NMT. The first approach employs the self-learning algorithm to generate the synthetic large-scale parallel data for NMT training. The second approach applies the multi-task learning framework using two NMTs to predict the translation and the reordered source-side monolingual sentences simultaneously. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods obtain significant improvements over the strong attention-based NMT.",2016,38,226,14,False,Computer Science,38358352,Jiajun Zhang,2423168.0,Chengqing Zong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, the support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high- (or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet a certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the ""curse of dimensionality."" Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results. Comparisons with other methods are also provided.",2003,95,234,28,True,Computer Science,2116664201,Yixin Chen,48094094.0,James Ze Wang,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus their correct application in a system's design may significantly improve its internal quality attributes such as reusability and maintainability. In software maintenance the existence of up-to-date documentation is crucial, so the discovery of as yet unknown design pattern instances can help improve the documentation. Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However, simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as state and strategy. In the present work we use machine learning to enhance pattern mining by filtering out as many false hits as possible. To do so we distinguish true and false pattern instances with the help of a learning database created by manually tagging a large C++ system.",2005,27,93,7,True,Computer Science,3172077,R.

Existing ML-as-a-service platforms require users to reveal all training data to the service operator. We design, implement, and evaluate Chiron, a system for privacy-preserving machine learning as a service. First, Chiron conceals the training data from the service operator. Second, in keeping with how many existing ML-as-a-service platforms work, Chiron reveals neither the training algorithm nor the model structure to the user, providing only black-box access to the trained model. Chiron is implemented using SGX enclaves, but SGX alone does not achieve the dual goals of data privacy and model confidentiality. Chiron runs the standard ML training toolchain (including the popular Theano framework and C compiler) in an enclave, but the untrusted model-creation code from the service operator is further confined in a Ryoan sandbox to prevent it from leaking the training data outside the enclave. To support distributed training, Chiron executes multiple concurrent enclaves that exchange model parameters via a parameter server. We evaluate Chiron on popular deep learning models, focusing on benchmark image classification tasks such as CIFAR and ImageNet, and show that its training performance and accuracy of the resulting models are practical for common uses of ML-as-a-service.",2018,54,145,14,False,Computer Science,48062937,T.
