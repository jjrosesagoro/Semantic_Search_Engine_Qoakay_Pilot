While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs. We demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of our approach on 3D point cloud classification and 3D surface estimation from single images.",2011,24,123,4,True,Computer Science,1700433,Stéphane Ross,51505748.0,Daniel Munoz,145670946.0,M.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.",2018,31,191,3,True,Medicine,145959882,G.

There has been considerable research toward the diagnosis and early detection of this disease in the past decade. The sensitivity of biomarkers and the accuracy of the detection techniques have been defined to be the key to an accurate diagnosis. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the research performed on the diagnosis of AD based on imaging and machine learning techniques. Different segmentation and machine learning techniques used for the diagnosis of AD are reviewed including thresholding, supervised and unsupervised learning, probabilistic techniques, Atlas-based approaches, and fusion of different image modalities. More recent and powerful classification techniques such as the enhanced probabilistic neural network of Ahmadlou and Adeli should be investigated with the goal of improving the diagnosis accuracy.

This paper attempts to bridge the fields of machine learning, robotics, and distributed AI. It discusses the use of communication in reducing the undesirable effects of locality in fully distributed multi-agent systems with multiple agents robots learning in parallel while interacting with each other. Two key problems, hidden state and credit assignment, are addressed by applying local undirected broadcast communication in a dual role: as sensing and as reinforcement. The methodology is demonstrated on two multi-robot learning experiments. The first describes learning a tightly-coupled coordination task with two robots, the second a loosely-coupled task with four robots learning social rules. Communication is used to (1) share sensory data to overcome hidden state and (2) share reinforcement to overcome the credit assignment problem between the agents and bridge the gap between local individual and global group pay-off.",1997,41,155,12,False,Computer Science,1742183,M.

Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",2019,108,518,7,True,Computer Science,1749801,Andreas Holzinger,2328333.0,G.

The whole system is composed of a part of intelligent core and of an HF special-purpose management tool also providing the function to act as interface for the artificial intelligence training and use. To implement the smart intelligent functions, we adopted a machine learning approach. In this paper, we compare the performance of a neural network (NN), a support vector machine, a system with fuzzy rules genetically produced, and a classification and regression tree and its direct evolution, which is the random forest, in analyzing our database. Best performances in both HF severity evaluation and HF-type prediction functions are obtained by using the random forest algorithm. The management tool allows the cardiologist to populate a “supervised database” suitable for machine learning during his or her regular outpatient consultations.

However, claims that stakeholders ""just won't accept that!"" do not provide a sufficient foundation for a proposed field of study. For the field of interpretable machine learning to advance, we must ask the following questions: What precisely won't various stakeholders accept? What do they want? Are these desiderata reasonable?

The first case occurs when obtaining examples of a second class is difficult, e.g., classifying sites of ""interest"" based on web accesses. The second situation is exemplified by the gene knock-out experiments for understanding Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor signalling pathway that provided the data for the second task of the KDD 2002 Cup, where minority one-class SVMs significantly outperform models learnt using examples from both classes.This paper explores the limits of supervised learning of a two class discrimination from data with heavily unbalanced class proportions. We focus on the case of supervised learning with support vector machines. We consider the impact of both sampling and weighting imbalance compensation techniques and then extend the balancing to extreme situations when one of the classes is ignored completely and the learning is accomplished using examples from a single class.Our investigation with the data for KDD 2002 Cup as well as text benchmarks such as Reuters Newswire shows that there is a consistent pattern of performance differences between one and two-class learning for all SVMs investigated, and these patterns persist even with aggressive dimensionality reduction through automated feature selection.

These exploration algorithms have been shown to allow real world robots to acquire skills such as tool use in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However, they have so far assumed that self-generated goals are sampled in a specifically engineered feature space, limiting their autonomy. In this work, we propose to use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space. This is a developmental 2-stage approach: first, in a perceptual learning stage, deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world changes to learn a corresponding latent space; then goal exploration happens in a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space.

To address this, we design MLNET, a host-based communication layer that aims to improve the network performance of distributed machine learning systems. This is achieved through a combination of traffic reduction techniques (to diminish network load in the core and at the edges) and traffic management (to reduce average training time). A key feature of MLNET is its compatibility with existing hardware and software infrastructure so it can be immediately deployed.

Although most techniques developed so far requires knowledge of the architecture of the machine learning model and remains hard to scale to complex prediction pipelines, the method of randomized smoothing has been shown to overcome many of these obstacles. By requiring only black-box access to the underlying model, randomized smoothing scales to large architectures and is agnostic to the internals of the network. However, past work on randomized smoothing has focused on restricted classes of smoothing measures or perturbations (like Gaussian or discrete) and has only been able to prove robustness with respect to simple norm bounds. In this paper we introduce a general framework for proving robustness properties of smoothed machine learning models in the black-box setting. Specifically, we extend randomized smoothing procedures to handle arbitrary smoothing measures and prove robustness of the smoothed classifier by using $f$-divergences.

Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. Support vector machines are a specific type of machine learning algorithm that are among the most widelyused for many statistical learning problems, such as spam filtering, text classification, handwriting analysis, face and object recognition, and countless others. Support vector machines have also come into widespread use in practically every area of bioinformatics within the last ten years, and their area of influence continues to expand today. The support vector machine has been developed as robust tool for classification and regression in noisy, complex domains. The two key features of support vector machines are generalization theory, which leads to a principled way to choose an hypothesis; and, kernel functions, which introduce nonlinearity in the hypothesis space without explicitly requiring a non-linear algorithm.",2012,17,107,4,False,Computer Science,73061226,H.

Automated track inspection using computer vision and pattern recognition methods has recently shown the potential to improve safety by allowing for more frequent inspections while reducing human errors. Achieving full automation is still very challenging due to the number of different possible failure modes, as well as the broad range of image variations that can potentially trigger false alarms. In addition, the number of defective components is very small, so not many training examples are available for the machine to learn a robust anomaly detector. In this paper, we show that detection performance can be improved by combining multiple detectors within a multitask learning framework. We show that this approach results in improved accuracy for detecting defects on railway ties and fasteners.",2015,54,246,5,True,Engineering,2067146341,Xavier Gibert,1741177.0,Vishal M.

The exact nonlinear model of underlying process is not precisely known, but a partially known nominal model is available. This partially known nonlinear model is first decomposed to an affine term plus an unknown high-order term via Jacobian linearization. The linearization residue combined with unmodeled dynamics is then modeled using an extreme learning machine via supervised learning. The minimax methodology is exploited to deal with bounded uncertainties. The minimax optimization problem is reformulated as a convex minimization problem and is iteratively solved by a two-layer recurrent neural network.

Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text’s category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.",2016,47,234,19,True,Computer Science,3422375,L.

However, the traditional L1MKL method often achieves worse results than the simplest method using the average of base kernels (i.e., average kernel) in some practical applications. In order to improve the effectiveness of MKL, this paper presents a novel soft margin perspective for MKL. Specifically, we introduce an additional slack variable called kernel slack variable to each quadratic constraint of MKL, which corresponds to one support vector machine model using a single base kernel. We first show that L1MKL can be deemed as hard margin MKL, and then we propose a novel soft margin framework for MKL. Three commonly used loss functions, including the hinge loss, the square hinge loss, and the square loss, can be readily incorporated into this framework, leading to the new soft margin MKL objective functions. Many existing MKL methods can be shown as special cases under our soft margin framework. For example, the hinge loss soft margin MKL leads to a new box constraint for kernel combination coefficients. Using different hyper-parameter values for this formulation, we can inherently bridge the method using average kernel, L1MKL, and the hinge loss soft margin MKL. The square hinge loss soft margin MKL unifies the family of elastic net constraint/regularizer based approaches; and the square loss soft margin MKL incorporates L2MKL naturally. Moreover, we also develop efficient algorithms for solving both the hinge loss and square hinge loss soft margin MKL. Comprehensive experimental studies for various MKL algorithms on several benchmark data sets and two real world applications, including video action recognition and event recognition demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can efficiently achieve an effective yet sparse solution for MKL.",2013,61,121,13,False,Mathematics,2658750,Xinxing Xu,1807998.0,I.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive review of such systems and analyzes key data management challenges and techniques. We focus on three complementary lines of work: (1) integrating ML algorithms and languages with existing data systems such as RDBMSs, (2) adapting data management-inspired techniques such as query optimization, partitioning, and compression to new systems that target ML workloads, and (3) combining data management and ML ideas to build systems that improve ML lifecycle-related tasks.

These expert systems, however, are far from optimal and should be improved to relieve the human editors from the burden of manually reverting such edits. We investigate the possibility of using machine learning techniques to build an autonomous system capable to distinguish vandalism from legitimate edits. We highlight the results of a small but important step in this direction by applying commonly known machine learning algorithms using a straightforward feature representation. Despite the promising results, this study reveals that elementary features, which are also used by the current approaches to fight vandalism, are not sufficient to build such a system.

The next generation of materials needs to be adaptive, multipurpose, and tunable. This is not possible by following the traditional experimentally guided trial‐and‐error process, as this limits the search for untapped regions of the solution space. Here, a computational data‐driven approach is followed for exploring a new metamaterial concept and adapting it to different target properties, choice of base materials, length scales, and manufacturing processes. Guided by Bayesian machine learning, two designs are fabricated at different length scales that transform brittle polymers into lightweight, recoverable, and supercompressible metamaterials. The macroscale design is tuned for maximum compressibility, achieving strains beyond 94% and recoverable strengths around 0.1 kPa, while the microscale design reaches recoverable strengths beyond 100 kPa and strains around 80%. The data‐driven code is available to facilitate future design and analysis of metamaterials and structures (https://github.com/mabessa/F3DAS).",2019,37,89,0,True,Medicine,73014519,M.

We show how the parameters of a function that has been fit to the video data can serve as a robust new video representation. As a specific example, we learn a pooling function via ranking machines. By learning to rank the frame-level features of a video in chronological order, we obtain a new representation that captures the video-wide temporal dynamics of a video, suitable for action recognition. Other than ranking functions, we explore different parametric models that could also explain the temporal changes in videos. The proposed functional pooling methods, and rank pooling in particular, is easy to interpret and implement, fast to compute and effective in recognizing a wide variety of actions. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks for generic action, fine-grained action and gesture recognition. Results show that rank pooling brings an absolute improvement of 7-10 average pooling baseline.

In many cases, increasing model capacity beyond the memory limit of a single accelerator has required developing special algorithms or infrastructure. These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators. We demonstrate the advantages of GPipe by training large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures: (i) Image Classification: We train a 557-million-parameter AmoebaNet model and attain a top-1 accuracy of 84.4% on ImageNet-2012, (ii) Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: We train a single 6-billion-parameter, 128-layer Transformer model on a corpus spanning over 100 languages and achieve better quality than all bilingual models.",2018,77,770,111,False,Computer Science,2145438541,Yanping Huang,50607661.0,Yonglong Cheng,7167328.0,Dehao Chen,34946720.0,HyoukJoong Lee,2020608.0,Jiquan Ngiam,2827616.0,Quoc V.

Although some areas of research have benefited tremendously from a new set of statistical tools, most often in the use of biological or genetic variables, the hype has not been substantiated in more traditional areas of research.

This shortcoming is showcased across a set of simulated examples, demonstrating that model selection between a machine-learning algorithm and regression depends on the measurement quality, regardless of sample size.

However, deep neural networks with the softmax classifier are known to produce highly overconfident posterior distributions even for such abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for detecting any abnormal samples, which is applicable to any pre-trained softmax neural classifier. We obtain the class conditional Gaussian distributions with respect to (low- and upper-level) features of the deep models under Gaussian discriminant analysis, which result in a confidence score based on the Mahalanobis distance. While most prior methods have been evaluated for detecting either out-of-distribution or adversarial samples, but not both, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances for both cases in our experiments. Moreover, we found that our proposed method is more robust in harsh cases, e.g., when the training dataset has noisy labels or small number of samples. Finally, we show that the proposed method enjoys broader usage by applying it to class-incremental learning: whenever out-of-distribution samples are detected, our classification rule can incorporate new classes well without further training deep models.",2018,32,924,252,False,Computer Science,3436470,Kimin Lee,2208511.0,Kibok Lee,1697141.0,Honglak Lee,143720148.0,Jinwoo Shin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central operation that appears in most of these areas is to measure the dierence between two multivariate Gaussians. Unfortunately, traditional measures based on the Kullback{ Leibler (KL) divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance do not satisfy all metric axioms necessary for many algorithms. In this paper we propose a modication for the KL divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance, for multivariate Gaussian densities, that transforms the two measures into distance metrics. Next, we show how these metric axioms impact the unfolding process of manifold learning algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the ecacy of the proposed metrics on two dierent manifold learning algorithms when used for motion clustering in video data.

Moreover, efficacy and safety were considered some of the major causes of clinical failures in the development of new chemical entities. In this context, machine learning (ML) techniques have been often used in ADME-Tox studies due to the existence of compounds with known pharmacokinetic properties available for generating predictive models. Areas covered: This review examines the growth in the use of some ML techniques in ADME-Tox studies, in particular supervised and unsupervised techniques. Also, some critical points (e.g., size of the data set and type of output variable) must be considered during the generation of models that relate ADME-Tox properties and biological activity. Expert opinion: ML techniques have been successfully employed in pharmacokinetic studies, helping the complex process of designing new drug candidates from the use of reliable ML models.

In 87% (coding and untranslated regions) and 95% (coding regions only) of all genes tested in several out-of-sample evaluations, our method correctly identified all exons and introns. Notably, only 37% and 50%, respectively, of the presently unconfirmed genes in the C. elegans genome annotation agree with our predictions, thus we hypothesize that a sizable fraction of those genes are not correctly annotated. A retrospective evaluation of the Wormbase WS120 annotation [1] of C. elegans reveals that splice form predictions on unconfirmed genes in WS120 are inaccurate in about 18% of the considered cases, while our predictions deviate from the truth only in 10%–13%. We experimentally analyzed 20 controversial genes on which our system and the annotation disagree, confirming the superiority of our predictions. While our method correctly predicted 75% of those cases, the standard annotation was never completely correct. The accuracy of our system is further corroborated by a comparison with two other recently proposed systems that can be used for splice form prediction: SNAP and ExonHunter. We conclude that the genome annotation of C. elegans and other organisms can be greatly enhanced using modern machine learning technology.",2006,46,84,0,True,Biology,2414086,G. Rätsch,3029782.0,S.

Building a neural network for such a problem presents a number of interesting challenges that have not occurred in tasks such as image processing or NLP. In particular, we note that detection from raw bytes presents a sequence problem with over two million time steps and a problem where batch normalization appear to hinder the learning process. We present our initial work in building a solution to tackle this problem, which has linear complexity dependence on the sequence length, and allows for interpretable sub-regions of the binary to be identified.

The extracted data was used for the development of a novel type classification approach based on supervised machine learning. The proposed classification approach employs a novel combination of features that achieves a high classification rate with a weighted average AUC value of 0.98 using Random Forests classifier.

Recently, deep learning methods applied to machine health monitoring have been proven effective. However, the existing methods face enormous difficulties in extracting heterogeneous features indicating the variation until failure and revealing the inherent high-dimensional features of massive signals, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of machine health monitoring. In this paper, a novel data-driven machine health monitoring method is proposed using adaptive kernel spectral clustering (AKSC) and deep long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN). This method include three steps: First, features in the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain are, respectively, extracted from massive measured signals. And, an Euclidean distance based algorithm is designed to select degradation features. Second, the AKSC algorithm is introduced to adaptively identify machine anomaly behaviors from multiple degradation features. Third, a new deep learning model (LSTM-RNN) is constructed to update and predict the failure time of the machine. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a set of test-to-failure experimental data.

Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.",2020,63,88,6,True,Medicine,16015502,D.

Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation.

The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures.

It has been successfully applied to modeling the visual receptive fields of the cortical neurons. Sufficient experimental results in neuroscience suggest that the temporal slowness principle is a general learning principle in visual perception. In this paper, we introduce the SFA framework to the problem of human action recognition by incorporating the discriminative information with SFA learning and considering the spatial relationship of body parts. In particular, we consider four kinds of SFA learning strategies, including the original unsupervised SFA (U-SFA), the supervised SFA (S-SFA), the discriminative SFA (D-SFA), and the spatial discriminative SFA (SD--SFA), to extract slow feature functions from a large amount of training cuboids which are obtained by random sampling in motion boundaries. Afterward, to represent action sequences, the squared first order temporal derivatives are accumulated over all transformed cuboids into one feature vector, which is termed the Accumulated Squared Derivative (ASD) feature. The ASD feature encodes the statistical distribution of slow features in an action sequence. Finally, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify actions represented by ASD features. We conduct extensive experiments, including two sets of control experiments, two sets of large scale experiments on the KTH and Weizmann databases, and two sets of experiments on the CASIA and UT-interaction databases, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SFA for human action recognition. Experimental results suggest that the SFA-based approach (1) is able to extract useful motion patterns and improves the recognition performance, (2) requires less intermediate processing steps but achieves comparable or even better performance, and (3) has good potential to recognize complex multiperson activities.",2012,50,289,8,True,Computer Science,2156120959,Zhang Zhang,143719920.0,D.
