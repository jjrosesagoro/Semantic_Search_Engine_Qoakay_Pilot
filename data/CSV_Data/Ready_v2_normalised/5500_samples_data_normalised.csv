Automated track inspection using computer vision and pattern recognition methods has recently shown the potential to improve safety by allowing for more frequent inspections while reducing human errors. Achieving full automation is still very challenging due to the number of different possible failure modes, as well as the broad range of image variations that can potentially trigger false alarms. In addition, the number of defective components is very small, so not many training examples are available for the machine to learn a robust anomaly detector. In this paper, we show that detection performance can be improved by combining multiple detectors within a multitask learning framework. We show that this approach results in improved accuracy for detecting defects on railway ties and fasteners.",2015,54,246,5,True,Engineering,2067146341,Xavier Gibert,1741177.0,Vishal M.

How do they do this? More specifically, how do children map from complex, physical signals to grammars that enable them to generate and interpret new utterances from their language? This thesis presents a computational theory of unsupervised language acquisition. By computational we mean that the theory precisely defines procedures for learning language, procedures that have been implemented and tested in the form of computer programs. By unsupervised we mean that the theory explains how language learning can take place with no explicit help from a teacher, but only exposure to ordinary spoken or written utterances. The theory requires very little of the learning environment. For example, it predicts that much knowledge of language can be acquired even in situations where the learner has no access to the meaning of utterances. In this way the theory is extremely conservative, making few or no assumptions that are not obviously true of the situation children learn in. The theory is based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical estimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic, generative model of language to the evidence. Thus, the goal of the learner is to acquire a grammar under which the evidence is ""typical"", in a statistical sense. Much of the thesis is devoted to explaining conditions that must hold for this learning strategy to arrive at the desired form of grammar. The thesis introduces a variety of technical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and grammars that has many linguistically and statistically desirable properties. In this representation, both utterances and parameters in the grammar are represented by composing parameters. A second contribution is a learning strategy that separates the ""content"" of linguistic parameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of the search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to language acquisition. The theory has been tested on problems of learning lexicons (vocabularies) from text and speech signals. It performs extremely well on various objective criteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same linguistic structure to utterances as humans do. The theory has application to data compression, speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval, and other tasks that rely on either structural or stochastic descriptions of language.

The first case occurs when obtaining examples of a second class is difficult, e.g., classifying sites of ""interest"" based on web accesses. The second situation is exemplified by the gene knock-out experiments for understanding Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor signalling pathway that provided the data for the second task of the KDD 2002 Cup, where minority one-class SVMs significantly outperform models learnt using examples from both classes.This paper explores the limits of supervised learning of a two class discrimination from data with heavily unbalanced class proportions. We focus on the case of supervised learning with support vector machines. We consider the impact of both sampling and weighting imbalance compensation techniques and then extend the balancing to extreme situations when one of the classes is ignored completely and the learning is accomplished using examples from a single class.Our investigation with the data for KDD 2002 Cup as well as text benchmarks such as Reuters Newswire shows that there is a consistent pattern of performance differences between one and two-class learning for all SVMs investigated, and these patterns persist even with aggressive dimensionality reduction through automated feature selection.

Such questions have a rich history spanning statistics, machine learning and theoretical computer science. Even in the most basic settings, the only known approaches are either computationally inefficient or lose dimension dependent factors in their error guarantees. This raises the following question: Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even possible, algorithmically? In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms for agnostically learning several fundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian, (2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product distributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of k Gaussians with identical spherical covariances.

Using these effectors, the bacteria subvert host cell processes during infection. Legionella pneumophila translocates effectors via the Icm/Dot type-IV secretion system and to date, approximately 100 effectors have been identified by various experimental and computational techniques. Effector identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the pathogenesis system in L. pneumophila as well as in other bacterial pathogens. Here, we formulate the task of effector identification as a classification problem: each L. pneumophila open reading frame (ORF) was classified as either effector or not. We computationally defined a set of features that best distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features cover a wide range of characteristics including taxonomical dispersion, regulatory data, genomic organization, similarity to eukaryotic proteomes and more. Machine learning algorithms utilizing these features were then applied to classify all the ORFs within the L. pneumophila genome. Using this approach we were able to predict and experimentally validate 40 new effectors, reaching a success rate of above 90%. Increasing the number of validated effectors to around 140, we were able to gain novel insights into their characteristics. Effectors were found to have low G+C content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of effectors originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their protozoan host. In addition, effectors were found to cluster in specific genomic regions. Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the C-terminal translocation signal required for effector translocation by the Icm/Dot secretion system. To conclude, we have discovered 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors, predicted over a hundred additional highly probable effectors, and shown the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the identification and characterization of bacterial pathogenesis determinants.",2009,52,224,15,True,Biology,48688893,D.

The “alleged” inferior performance of TSVM is mainly because it was not tuned in the process, in addition to the involved minimization routines.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.",2020,18,236,27,False,Computer Science,39483391,Hao Wang,2005216177.0,Zakhary Kaplan,,1714907.0,Di Niu,,91269142.0,Baochun Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These methods define a cooperative game between the features of a model and distribute influence among these input elements using some form of the game's unique Shapley values. Justification for these methods rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning.

A sibling problem that has received relatively less attention is how to ensure efficient and correct model parallel execution of ML algorithms, where parameters of an ML program are partitioned to different workers and undergone concurrent iterative updates. We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design, algorithmic adjustment, and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we develop a system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs. STRADS enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models, and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML.

However, data privacy severely restricts the applicability of such services, unless measures to keep client data private (even from the service provider) are designed. Equally important is to minimize the amount of computation and communication required between client and server. Fully homomorphic encryption offers a possible way out, whereby clients may encrypt their data, and on which the server may perform arithmetic computations. The main drawback of using fully homomorphic encryption is the amount of time required to evaluate large machine learning models on encrypted data.

Faces contain information that can be used to interpret levels of drowsiness. There are many facial features that can be extracted from the face to infer the level of drowsiness. These include eye blinks, head movements and yawning. However, the development of a drowsiness detection system that yields reliable and accurate results is a challenging task as it requires accurate and robust algorithms. A wide range of techniques has been examined to detect driver drowsiness in the past. The recent rise of deep learning requires that these algorithms be revisited to evaluate their accuracy in detection of drowsiness. As a result, this paper reviews machine learning techniques which include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models in the context of drowsiness detection. Furthermore, a meta-analysis is conducted on 25 papers that use machine learning techniques for drowsiness detection. The analysis reveals that support vector machine technique is the most commonly used technique to detect drowsiness, but convolutional neural networks performed better than the other two techniques. Finally, this paper lists publicly available datasets that can be used as benchmarks for drowsiness detection.",2017,54,59,2,False,Computer Science,32559888,Mkhuseli Ngxande,3165624.0,J.

In recent years, the number of applications to the UTCS PhD program has become too large to manage with a traditional review process. GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant’s file that matter the most. An evaluation over two seasons of PhD admissions indicates that the system leads to dramatic time savings, reducing the total time spent on reviews by at least 74 percent.",2013,12,58,1,True,Computer Science,40418206,Austin Waters,1686788.0,R.

This study aims to evaluate different machine learning techniques in prediction of advanced fibrosis by combining the serum bio-markers and clinical information to develop the classification models. Methods: A prospective cohort of 39,567 patients with chronic hepatitis C was divided into two sets—one categorized as mild to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2), and the other categorized as advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) according to METAVIR score. Decision tree, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and multi-linear regression models for advanced fibrosis risk prediction were developed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. Results: Age, platelet count, AST, and albumin were found to be statistically significant to advanced fibrosis.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.",2014,41,419,66,False,Computer Science,2865775,J.

This weight vector is usually obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Based on this fact we present a direct method to build sparse kernel learning algorithms by adding one more constraint to the original convex optimization problem, such that the sparseness of the resulting kernel machine is explicitly controlled while at the same time performance is kept as high as possible. A gradient based approach is provided to solve this modified optimization problem. Applying this method to the support vectom machine results in a concrete algorithm for building sparse large margin classifiers.

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.",2009,64,1071,37,False,Computer Science,1777528,H.

However, the performances of existing machine learning–based damage identification methods are heavily dependent on the selected signatures from raw signals. This will cause the fact that the damage identification method, which is the optimal solution for a specific application, may fail to provide the similar performance on other cases. Besides, the feature extraction is a time-consuming task, which may affect the real-time performance in practical applications. To address these problems, this article proposes a novel method based on deep convolutional neural networks to identify and localise damages of building structures equipped with smart control devices. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is capable of automatically extracting high-level features from raw signals or low-level features and optimally selecting the combination of extracted features via a multi-layer fusion to satisfy any damage identification objective. To evaluate the performance of the proposed deep convolutional neural network method, a five-level benchmark building equipped with adaptive smart isolators subjected to the seismic loading is investigated. The result shows that the proposed method has outstanding generalisation capacity and higher identification accuracy than other commonly used machine learning methods. Accordingly, it is deemed as an ideal and effective method for damage identification of smart structures.",2018,54,125,1,True,Computer Science,2152845752,Yang Yu,2518211.0,Chaoyue Wang,,51099962.0,X.

However, compared to rigid robots, soft robots have issues in modeling, calibration, and control in that the innate characteristics of the soft materials can cause complex behaviors due to non-linearity and hysteresis. To overcome these limitations, recent studies have applied various approaches based on machine learning. This paper presents existing machine learning techniques in the soft robotic fields and categorizes the implementation of machine learning approaches in different soft robotic applications, which include soft sensors, soft actuators, and applications such as soft wearable robots. An analysis of the trends of different machine learning approaches with respect to different types of soft robot applications is presented; in addition to the current limitations in the research field, followed by a summary of the existing machine learning methods for soft robots.",2021,155,37,1,True,Medicine,2109288396,Daekyum Kim,2118808270.0,Sang-Hun Kim,,114692423.0,Taekyoung Kim,,36236553.0,B.

The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. The use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. Standard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. As a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. Text categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods.",1991,0,460,47,False,Computer Science,35153517,D.

One of the potential schemes to achieve this property is the federated learning (FL), which consists of several clients or local nodes learning on their own data and a central node to aggregate the models collected from those local nodes. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done in quantum machine learning (QML) in federation setting yet. In this work, we present the federated training on hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models although our framework could be generalized to pure quantum machine learning model.

We propose a novel multicategory generalization of ψ-learning that treats all classes simultaneously. The new generalization eliminates this potential problem while at the same time retaining the desirable properties of its binary counterpart. We develop a statistical learning theory for the proposed methodology and obtain fast convergence rates for both linear and nonlinear learning examples.

To facilitate the detection machine learning and deep learning methods are increasingly investigated with the aim of improving patient diagnosis, treatment options and outcomes. A review of the relevant works in the expanding field of radiomics for survival prediction from cancer is provided. Research works outside the field of radiomics which define techniques that may be of future use to improve feature extraction and analysis are also reviewed. Radiomics is a rapidly advancing field of clinical image analysis with a vast potential for supporting decision making involved in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The realisation of this goal of more effective decision making requires significant individual and integrated expertise from domain experts in medicine, biology and computer science to allow advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques to be applied effectively.

The problem consists in finding the learning machine that optimally emulates the examples, thus reproducing the unknown unitary with maximum fidelity. Learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state of a quantum memory (the memory of the learning machine) and subsequently retrieving it. We prove that, whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a group, the optimal strategy consists in a parallel call of the available uses followed by a 'measure-and-rotate' retrieving. Differing from the case of quantum cloning, where the incoherent 'measure-and-prepare' strategies are typically suboptimal, in the case of learning the 'measure-and-rotate' strategy is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy of the unknown unitary.

This paper reviewed the research of diagnosing mental illness using ML algorithm and suggests how ML techniques can be employed and worked in practice. Methods Researches about mental illness diagnostic using ML techniques were carefully reviewed. Five traditional ML algorithms-Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)-frequently used for mental health area researches were systematically organized and summarized.

In this paper, we propose a new data repairing approach that is based on maximizing the likelihood of replacement data given the data distribution, which can be modeled using statistical machine learning techniques. This is a novel approach combining machine learning and likelihood methods for cleaning dirty databases by value modification. We develop a quality measure of the repairing updates based on the likelihood benefit and the amount of changes applied to the database. We propose SCARE (SCalable Automatic REpairing), a systematic scalable framework that follows our approach. SCARE relies on a robust mechanism for horizontal data partitioning and a combination of machine learning techniques to predict the set of possible updates. Due to data partitioning, several updates can be predicted for a single record based on local views on each data partition. Therefore, we propose a mechanism to combine the local predictions and obtain accurate final predictions.

Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs. We demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of our approach on 3D point cloud classification and 3D surface estimation from single images.",2011,24,123,4,True,Computer Science,1700433,Stéphane Ross,51505748.0,Daniel Munoz,,145670946.0,M.

Adult educators have not challenged the desirability of that perspective directly, although various theorists suggest its modification through greater learner participation, problem-centeredness, experience basing, and concern for different learning styles. This article raises questions about the universal valuing of behaviorism in workplace learning based on a review of trends in organizations in the post-industrial era and analysis of theorists within and outside the field who emphasize the importance of reflectivity and critical reflectivity in learning. The author then describes emerging characteristics of a new paradigm for understanding workplace learning and concludes with a discussion of its limits.",1988,18,171,15,False,Psychology,7259424,V.

There has been considerable research toward the diagnosis and early detection of this disease in the past decade. The sensitivity of biomarkers and the accuracy of the detection techniques have been defined to be the key to an accurate diagnosis. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the research performed on the diagnosis of AD based on imaging and machine learning techniques. Different segmentation and machine learning techniques used for the diagnosis of AD are reviewed including thresholding, supervised and unsupervised learning, probabilistic techniques, Atlas-based approaches, and fusion of different image modalities. More recent and powerful classification techniques such as the enhanced probabilistic neural network of Ahmadlou and Adeli should be investigated with the goal of improving the diagnosis accuracy. A combination of different image modalities can help improve the diagnosis accuracy rate. Research is needed on the combination of modalities to discover multi-modal biomarkers.",2016,161,69,2,False,Computer Science,3296202,G. Mirzaei,1402038422.0,Anahita Adeli,Medicine,1750050.0,H.

Action description is based on local shape and motion information appearing at spatiotemporal locations of interest in a video. Action representation involves fuzzy vector quantization, while action classification is performed by a feedforward neural network. A novel classification algorithm, called minimum class variance extreme learning machine, is proposed in order to enhance the action classification performance. The proposed method can successfully operate in situations that may appear in real application scenarios, since it does not set any assumption concerning the visual scene background and the camera view angle. Experimental results on five publicly available databases, aiming at different application scenarios, denote the effectiveness of both the adopted action recognition approach and the proposed minimum class variance extreme learning machine algorithm.",2013,52,104,5,False,Mathematics,3074923,Alexandros Iosifidis,1737071.0,A.

The models are computed on the basis of examination data, i.e. data available at all universities without the need of specific collection. Therefore, we propose a methodical approach that may be put in practice with relative ease at other institutions. We find decision trees to produce slightly better results than logistic regressions. However, both methods yield high prediction accuracies of up to 95% after three semesters. A classification with more than 83% accuracy is already possible after the first semester.",2020,35,55,2,False,Psychology,81211589,Lorenz Kemper,1581770469.0,Gerrit Vorhoff,,107782312.0,Berthold U.

Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.",2015,23,778,19,True,Computer Science,47793005,Junshui Ma,1838644.0,R.

This development should lead to sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as machine learning, have already been established in the industry to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.",2020,30,96,1,True,Engineering,77613442,R.

We exemplify this translation procedure for a new algorithm: one-class leveraging, starting from the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM). This is a first step toward unsupervised learning in a boosting framework. Building on so-called barrier methods known from the theory of constrained optimization, it returns a function, written as a convex combination of base hypotheses, that characterizes whether a given test point is likely to have been generated from the distribution underlying the training data.
