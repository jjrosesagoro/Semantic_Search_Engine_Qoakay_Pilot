Toward that goal, the authors propose a novel representation for the recognition of protein–protein interaction sites that integrates enhanced relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predictions with high resolution structural data. An observation that RSA predictions are biased toward the level of surface exposure consistent with protein complexes led the authors to investigate the difference between the predicted and actual (i.e., observed in an unbound structure) RSA of an amino acid residue as a fingerprint of interaction sites. The authors demonstrate that RSA prediction‐based fingerprints of protein interactions significantly improve the discrimination between interacting and noninteracting sites, compared with evolutionary conservation, physicochemical characteristics, structure‐derived and other features considered before. On the basis of these observations, the authors developed a new method for the prediction of protein–protein interaction sites, using machine learning approaches to combine the most informative features into the final predictor. For training and validation, the authors used several large sets of protein complexes and derived from them nonredundant representative chains, with interaction sites mapped from multiple complexes. Alternative machine learning techniques are used, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, so as to evaluate the relative effects of the choice of a representation and a specific learning algorithm. The effects of induced fit and uncertainty of the negative (noninteracting) class assignment are also evaluated. Several representative methods from the literature are reimplemented to enable direct comparison of the results. Using rigorous validation protocols, the authors estimated that the new method yields the overall classification accuracy of about 74% and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.42, as opposed to up to 70% classification accuracy and up to 0.3 Matthews correlation coefficient for methods that do not utilize RSA prediction‐based fingerprints.

While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to push forward the interface between these two important subfields, which have been largely treated as isolated in the community.",2012,89,142,13,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,145254043,Jun Zhu,1406245631.0,Ning Chen,143977260.0,E.

In this paper, a novel and effective geospatial object detection framework is proposed by combining the weakly supervised learning (WSL) and high-level feature learning. First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning. Comprehensive experiments on three optical RSI data sets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach in benchmarking with several state-of-the-art supervised-learning-based object detection approaches.",2015,46,616,6,True,Computer Science,,7181955,Junwei Han,39901030.0,Dingwen Zhang,2152127024.0,Gong Cheng,143621713.0,Lei Guo,145811527.0,Jinchang Ren,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This in turn has created intriguing new opportunities for data-driven machine learning (ML). Convenient access to crowd workers for simple data collection has further generalized to leveraging more arbitrary crowd-based human computation (von Ahn 2005) to supplement automated ML. While new potential applications of crowdsourcing continue to emerge, a variety of practical and sometimes unexpected obstacles have already limited the degree to which its promised potential can be actually realized in practice. This paper considers two particular aspects of crowdsourcing and their interplay, data quality control (QC) and ML, reflecting on where we have been, where we are, and where we might go from here.",2011,26,143,8,False,Computer Science,,1747771,Matthew Lease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the increased popularity of GS approaches, numerous models have been proposed and no comparative analysis is available to identify the most promising ones. Using eight wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., and maize (Zea mays L.) datasets, the predictive ability of currently available GS models along with several machine learning methods was evaluated by comparing accuracies, the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), and the marker effects for each model. While a similar level of accuracy was observed for many models, the level of overfi tting varied widely as did the computation time and the distribution of marker effect estimates. Our comparisons suggested that GS in plant breeding programs could be based on a reduced set of models such as the Bayesian Lasso, weighted Bayesian shrinkage regression (wBSR, a fast version of BayesB), and random forest (RF) (a machine learning method that could capture nonadditive effects). Linear combinations of different models were tested as well as bagging and boosting methods, but they did not improve accuracy. This study also showed large differences in accuracy between subpopulations within a dataset that could not always be explained by differences in phenotypic variance and size. The broad diversity of empirical datasets tested here adds evidence that GS could increase genetic gain per unit of time and cost.",2012,56,512,28,False,Biology,,3181216,N.

The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of different classification techniques in data mining. Data mining involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data set. These tools can include statistical models, mathematical algorithm and machine learning methods. Consequently, data mining consists of more than collection and managing data, it also includes analysis and prediction. Classification technique is capable of processing a wider variety of data than regression and is growing in popularity. There are several applications for Machine Learning (ML), the most significant of which is data mining.

This classical problem has received much attention because of the simple model it provides of the trade-off between exploration (trying out each arm to find the best one) and exploitation (playing the arm believed to give the best payoff). Past solutions for the bandit problem have almost always relied on assumptions about the statistics of the slot machines. In this work, we make no statistical assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the process generating the payoffs of the slot machines. We give a solution to the bandit problem in which an adversary, rather than a well-behaved stochastic process, has complete control over the payoffs. In a sequence of T plays, we prove that the expected per-round payoff of our algorithm approaches that of the best arm at the rate O(T/sup -1/3/), and we give an improved rate of convergence when the best arm has fairly low payoff. We also consider a setting in which the player has a team of ""experts"" advising him on which arm to play; here, we give a strategy that will guarantee expected payoff close to that of the best expert.

Motion-activated cameras (“camera traps”) are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and have been regarded as among the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analyzed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. 2. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or “out-of-distribution” in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. 3. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82% accuracy, and correctly identified 94% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an R package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification; MLWIC) that allows the users to A) implement the trained model presented here and B) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. 4. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analyzing images. We present an R package making these methods accessible to ecologists.

Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known, our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms of identifying the m best arms. We introduce generic notions of complexity for the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves information-theoretic quantities and holds when m ≥ 1 under general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive refined lower bounds in both the fixedcon fidence and fixed-budget settings, along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times.

The 5G communication networks are getting complex due to emergence of unprecedentedly huge number of new connected devices and new types of services. Moreover, the requirements of creating virtual network slices suitable to provide optimal services for diverse users and applications are posing challenges to the efficient management of network resources, processing information about a huge volume of traffic, staying robust against all potential security threats, and adaptively adjustment of network functionality for time-varying workload. In this paper, we introduce about the envisioned 5G network slicing and elaborate the necessity of automation of network functions for the design, construction, deployment, operation, control and management of network slices.

This paper explores the use of machine-learning based alternatives to standard statistical data completion (data imputation) methods, for dealing with missing data. We have approached the data completion problem using two well-known machine learning techniques. The first is an unsupervised clustering strategy which uses a Bayesian approach to cluster the data into classes. The classes so obtained are then used to predict multiple choices for the attribute of interest. The second technique involves modeling missing variables by supervised induction of a decision tree-based classifier. This predicts the most likely value for the attribute of interest. Empirical tests using extracts from industrial databases maintained by Honeywell customers have been done in order to compare the two techniques. These tests show both approaches are useful and have advantages and disadvantages. We argue that the choice between unsupervised and supervised classification techniques should be influenced by the motivation for solving the missing data problem, and discuss potential applications for the procedures we are developing.",1996,8,142,2,False,Computer Science,,1831282,K.

Kernel methods form an important class of techniques that induce a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for inferring non-linear models through the construction of similarity functions from data. These methods are particularly preferred in cases where the training data sizes are limited and when prior knowledge of the data similarities is available. Despite their usefulness, they are limited by the computational complexity and their inability to support end-to-end learning with a task-specific objective. On the other hand, deep neural networks have become the de facto solution for end-to-end inference in several learning paradigms. In this paper, we explore the idea of using deep architectures to perform kernel machine optimization, for both computational efficiency and end-to-end inferencing. To this end, we develop the deep kernel machine optimization framework, that creates an ensemble of dense embeddings using Nyström kernel approximations and utilizes deep learning to generate task-specific representations through the fusion of the embeddings. Intuitively, the filters of the network are trained to fuse information from an ensemble of linear subspaces in the RKHS. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel dropout regularization to enable improved training convergence. Finally, we extend this framework to the multiple kernel case, by coupling a global fusion layer with pretrained deep kernel machines for each of the constituent kernels. Using case studies with limited training data, and lack of explicit feature sources, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over conventional model inferencing techniques.",2017,71,42,2,False,Computer Science,Medicine,72482217,Huan Song,121241127.0,Jayaraman J.

Traditional machine learning solutions assume the existence of (cloud-based) central entities that are in charge of processing the data. Nonetheless, the difficulty of accessing private data, together with the high cost of transmitting raw data to the central entity gave rise to a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. The main idea of federated learning is to perform an on-device collaborative training of a single machine learning model without having to share the raw training data with any third-party entity. Although few survey articles on federated learning already exist in the literature, the motivation of this survey stems from three essential observations. The first one is the lack of a fine-grained multi-level classification of the federated learning literature, where the existing surveys base their classification on only one criterion or aspect. The second observation is that the existing surveys focus only on some common challenges, but disregard other essential aspects such as reliable client selection, resource management and training service pricing. The third observation is the lack of explicit and straightforward directives for researchers to help them design future federated learning solutions that overcome the state-of-the-art research gaps. To address these points, we first provide a comprehensive tutorial on federated learning and its associated concepts, technologies and learning approaches. We then survey and highlight the applications and future directions of federated learning in the domain of communication and networking. Thereafter, we design a three-level classification scheme that first categorizes the federated learning literature based on the high-level challenge that they tackle. Then, we classify each high-level challenge into a set of specific low-level challenges to foster a better understanding of the topic. Finally, we provide, within each low-level challenge, a fine-grained classification based on the technique used to address this particular challenge. For each category of high-level challenges, we provide a set of desirable criteria and future research directions that are aimed to help the research community design innovative and efficient future solutions. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the most comprehensive in terms of challenges and techniques it covers and the most fine-grained in terms of the multi-level classification scheme it presents.",2021,185,109,7,True,Computer Science,,2539141,O.

To enjoy this benefit, inter-device communication overhead should be minimized. With this end, we propose federated distillation (FD), a distributed model training algorithm whose communication payload size is much smaller than a benchmark scheme, federated learning (FL), particularly when the model size is large. Moreover, user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data towards yielding an IID dataset.

Training on data from many environments and finding invariant predictors reduces the effect of spurious features by concentrating models on features that have a causal relationship with the outcome. In this work, we pose such invariant risk minimization as finding the Nash equilibrium of an ensemble game among several environments. By doing so, we develop a simple training algorithm that uses best response dynamics and, in our experiments, yields similar or better empirical accuracy with much lower variance than the challenging bi-level optimization problem of Arjovsky et al. (2019). One key theoretical contribution is showing that the set of Nash equilibria for the proposed game are equivalent to the set of invariant predictors for any finite number of environments, even with nonlinear classifiers and transformations. As a result, our method also retains the generalization guarantees to a large set of environments shown in Arjovsky et al. (2019).

Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. We pay particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction Daume III et al. [2009]. To structure this discussion, we categorize imitation learning techniques based on the following key criteria which drive algorithmic decisions: 1) The structure of the policy space. Is the learned policy a time-index trajectory (trajectory learning), a mapping from observations to actions (so called behavioral cloning [Bain and Sammut, 1996]), or the result of a complex optimization or planning problem at each execution as is common in inverse optimal control methods [Kalman, 1964, Moylan and Anderson, 1973]. 2) The information available during training and testing. In particular, is the learning algorithm privy to the full state that the teacher possess? Is the learner able to interact with the teacher and gather corrections or more data? Does the learner have a (typically a priori) model of the system with which it interacts? Does the learner have access to the reward (cost) function that the teacher is attempting to optimize? 3) The notion of success. Different algorithmic approaches provide varying guarantees on the resulting learned behavior. These guarantees range from weaker (e.g., measuring disagreement with the agent’s decision) to stronger (e.g., providing guarantees on the performance of the learner with respect to a true cost function, either known or unknown). We organize our work by paying particular attention to distinction (1): dividing imitation learning into directly replicating desired behavior (sometimes called behavioral cloning) and learning the hidden objectives of the desired behavior from demonstrations (called inverse optimal control or inverse reinforcement learning [Russell, 1998]). In the latter case, behavior arises as the result of an optimization problem solved for each new instance that the learner faces. In addition to method analysis, we discuss the design decisions a practitioner must make when selecting an imitation learning approach. Moreover, application examples—such as robots that play table tennis [Kober and Peters, 2009], programs that play the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016], and systems that understand natural language [Wen et al., 2015]— illustrate the properties and motivations behind different forms of imitation learning.

The resulting dividing surfaces require no a priori information or intuition about reaction mechanisms. To generate optimal dividing surfaces, we apply a cycle of machine-learning and refinement of the surface by molecular dynamics sampling. We demonstrate that the machine-learned surfaces contain the relevant low-energy saddle points. The mechanisms of reactions may be extracted from the machine-learned surfaces in order to identify unexpected chemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we show that the machine-learned surfaces significantly increase the transmission coefficient for an adatom exchange involving many coupled degrees of freedom on a (100) surface when compared to a distance-based dividing surface.",2012,47,83,1,False,Computer Science,Medicine,3583421,Zachary D.

Despite the growing number of students using MT, little is known about its use as a pedagogical tool in the EFL classroom. The present study investigated the role of MT as a CALL tool in EFL writing. Most studies on MT as a tool for L2 learning have focused on student postediting of the translation that MT provides; however, the present study employed a different design with students translating their L1 writing into L2 without the help of MT and then correcting their L2 writing using the MT translation for comparison. Text analysis of students’ writing outcomes revealed that MT helped to decrease lexico-grammatical errors and improve student revisions. Using MT for revisions also positively affected student writing strategies and helped them think of writing as a process. The interviews and reflection papers demonstrated that students viewed the use of MT during writing positively. This study found that MT can be a useful aid to language learning, but for it to benefit student learning, teachers must be aware of its limitations and provide adequate guidance to students.",2020,58,74,7,False,Computer Science,,3428747,Sangmin-Michelle Lee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a glove as an intuitive and low‐cost HMI can expediently track the motions of human fingers, resulting in a straightforward communication media of human–machine interactions. When combining several triboelectric textile sensors and proper machine learning technique, it has great potential to realize complex gesture recognition with the minimalist‐designed glove for the comprehensive control in both real and virtual space. However, humidity or sweat may negatively affect the triboelectric output as well as the textile itself. Hence, in this work, a facile carbon nanotubes/thermoplastic elastomer (CNTs/TPE) coating approach is investigated in detail to achieve superhydrophobicity of the triboelectric textile for performance improvement. With great energy harvesting and human motion sensing capabilities, the glove using the superhydrophobic textile realizes a low‐cost and self‐powered interface for gesture recognition.

Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of societies, information diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable.

This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis.

The experiments are conducted for an German to English translation task. As additional linguistic resources, we exploit POS information and named-entities (NE).

While many machine learning models have been developed to predict mortality, they are rarely applied in the clinical literature, where classification tasks typically rely on logistic regression. One reason for this is that existing machine learning models often seek to optimize predictions by incorporating features that are not present in the databases readily available to providers and policy makers, limiting generalizability and implementation. Here we tested a number of machine learning classifiers for prediction of six-month mortality in a population of elderly Medicare beneficiaries, using an administrative claims database of the kind available to the majority of health care payers and providers. We show that machine learning classifiers substantially outperform current widely-used methods of risk prediction-but only when used with an improved feature set incorporating insights from clinical medicine, developed for this study.

Introduction.-This note introduces some nonlinear difference-differential equations which can be interpreted as a learning theory or, alternatively, as a prediction theory whose goal is to discuss the prediction of individual events, in a fixed order, and at prescribed times. The theory provides a mathematical description of the following kind of experiment. An experimenter g, confronted by a machine MlZ, presents M with a list of ""letters"" or ""events"" to be learned. Suppose, for example, that g wishes to teach 9Mt the list of letters AB, or to predict the event B, given the event A. g does this by presenting A and then B to M several times. To find out if SE has learned the list as a result of these list presentations, the letter A alone is then presented to M. If M responds with the letter B, and M does this whenever A alone is said, then we have good evidence that MR has indeed learned the list AB. Thus M learns to predict the event B whenever the event A occurs as a result of repeated presentations of the list AB. We will introduce some mathematical machines that learn lists in the above manner. These machines have some properties that have a familiar intuitive interpretation. For example, in our simplest machine, it is possible to make rigorous the heuristic statements that (1) ""practice makes perfect,"" (2) an isolated system suffers no memory loss, (3) an isolated system remembers without practicing overtly, (4) the memory of an isolated system sometimes spontaneously improves without practice, (5) all errors can be corrected, although the rate of correction is sometimes diminished by response interference due to prior learning, (6) increasing the number of response alternatives sometimes diminishes the learning rate, and so on. All of the machines we will introduce possess the same dynamical laws. Nonetheless , the exact manner in which a given machine learns and remembers depends crucially on the particular way in which the components of the machine are interconnected ; i.e., on its ""geometry."" For example, properties (2) and (3) above do not hold in all the machines we shall describe. In this note, we will sketch some results for our simplest machine. These results, along with results for more complicated machines, are described in greater detail in another place.' 2.

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on part of the data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and the validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular CV methods: record-wise and subject-wise. While the subject-wise method mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosis in newly recruited subjects, the record-wise strategy has no such interpretation. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise CV often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method was used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning-based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as inaccurate results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.",2017,41,145,2,False,Computer Science,Medicine,3059087,Sohrab Saeb,3146304.0,L.

Traditionally, various statistical methods were used for modeling crash injury severities. In recent years, machine learning-based methods are becoming popular due to their good predictive performance. However, the machine learning-based models are usually criticized as they perform like a black-box. In this paper, we aim at comparing the predictive performance, including prediction accuracy and estimation of variable importance, among various machine learning and statistical methods with distinct modeling logic for crash severity analysis. The crash severity, road geometry, and traffic flow data were collected at freeway diverge areas in Florida. We estimated two most commonly used statistical methods which were ordered probit (OP) model and multinomial logit model, and four popular machine learning methods, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine. The correct prediction rate for each crash severity level and the overall correct prediction rate were calculated. The results showed that the machine learning methods had higher predicting accuracy than the statistical methods, though they suffered from over-fitting issue. The RF method had the best prediction in overall and severe crashes while OP was the weakest one. We compared variable importance on crash severity via perturbation-based sensitivity analyses. The results showed that the inferences of variable importance from different methods were not always consistent and should be paid careful attention.",2018,51,68,2,False,Computer Science,,2151811241,Jian Zhang,2109752718.0,Zhibin Li,30665376.0,Ziyuan Pu,71868821.0,Chengcheng Xu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The performance of each regressor/representation/property combination is assessed using learning curves which report out-of-sample errors as a function of training set size with up to ∼118k distinct molecules. Molecular structures and properties at the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level of theory come from the QM9 database [ Ramakrishnan et al. Sci. Data 2014 , 1 , 140022 ] and include enthalpies and free energies of atomization, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, dipole moment, polarizability, zero point vibrational energy, heat capacity, and the highest fundamental vibrational frequency. Various molecular representations have been studied (Coulomb matrix, bag of bonds, BAML and ECFP4, molecular graphs (MG)), as well as newly developed distribution based variants including histograms of distances (HD), angles (HDA/MARAD), and dihedrals (HDAD). Regressors include linear models (Bayesian ridge regression (BR) and linear regression with elastic net regularization (EN)), random forest (RF), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and two types of neural networks, graph convolutions (GC) and gated graph networks (GG). Out-of sample errors are strongly dependent on the choice of representation and regressor and molecular property. Electronic properties are typically best accounted for by MG and GC, while energetic properties are better described by HDAD and KRR. The specific combinations with the lowest out-of-sample errors in the ∼118k training set size limit are (free) energies and enthalpies of atomization (HDAD/KRR), HOMO/LUMO eigenvalue and gap (MG/GC), dipole moment (MG/GC), static polarizability (MG/GG), zero point vibrational energy (HDAD/KRR), heat capacity at room temperature (HDAD/KRR), and highest fundamental vibrational frequency (BAML/RF). We present numerical evidence that ML model predictions deviate from DFT (B3LYP) less than DFT (B3LYP) deviates from experiment for all properties. Furthermore, out-of-sample prediction errors with respect to hybrid DFT reference are on par with, or close to, chemical accuracy.

This limits their usability for many practical problems, for instance, when training data arrives sequentially or the underlying distribution is continuously changing. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line random forest algorithm. We combine ideas from on-line bagging, extremely randomized forests and propose an on-line decision tree growing procedure. Additionally, we add a temporal weighting scheme for adaptively discarding some trees based on their out-of-bag-error in given time intervals and consequently growing of new trees. The experiments on common machine learning data sets show that our algorithm converges to the performance of the off-line RF. Additionally, we conduct experiments for visual tracking, where we demonstrate real-time state-of-the-art performance on well-known scenarios and show good performance in case of occlusions and appearance changes where we outperform trackers based on on-line boosting.

In the Emergency Department, where suicidal patients often present, estimating the risk of repeated attempts is generally left to clinical judgment. This paper presents our second attempt to determine the role of computational algorithms in understanding a suicidal patient's thoughts, as represented by suicide notes. We focus on developing methods of natural language processing that distinguish between genuine and elicited suicide notes. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can categorize suicide notes as well as mental health professionals and psychiatric physician trainees do. The data used are comprised of suicide notes from 33 suicide completers and matched to 33 elicited notes from healthy control group members. Eleven mental health professionals and 31 psychiatric trainees were asked to decide if a note was genuine or elicited. Their decisions were compared to nine different machine-learning algorithms. The results indicate that trainees accurately classified notes 49% of the time, mental health professionals accurately classified notes 63% of the time, and the best machine learning algorithm accurately classified the notes 78% of the time.

Yet, as of today, distributed machine learning frameworks have largely ignored the possibility of arbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) failures. In this paper, we study the robustness to Byzantine failures at the fundamental level of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the heart of most machine learning algorithms. Assuming a set of $n$ workers, up to $f$ of them being Byzantine, we ask how robust can SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient descent update rule based on a linear combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property of the update rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite $f$ Byzantine workers. We finally propose Krum, an update rule that satisfies the resilience property aforementioned.

In such a situation, how to enhance predictability of classification through unlabeled data is the focus. In this article, we introduce a novel large margin semi-supervised learning methodology, using grouping information from unlabeled data, together with the concept of margins, in a form of regularization controlling the interplay between labeled and unlabeled data. Based on this methodology, we develop two specific machines involving support vector machines and ψ-learning, denoted as SSVM and SPSI, through difference convex programming. In addition, we estimate the generalization error using both labeled and unlabeled data, for tuning regularizers. Finally, our theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the proposed methodology achieves the desired objective of delivering high performance in generalization, particularly against some strong performers.",2007,43,50,0,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,46585202,Junhui Wang,2266946.0,Xiaotong Shen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest advances in machine learning that use deep convolutional neural networks allow a machine to automatically learn the features directly from data, minimizing the need for input from human experts. We present a star-galaxy classification framework that uses deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) directly on the reduced, calibrated pixel values. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), we demonstrate that ConvNets are able to produce accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic classifications that are competitive with conventional machine learning techniques. Future advances in deep learning may bring more success with current and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), because deep neural networks require very little, manual feature engineering.",2016,86,116,3,True,Computer Science,Physics,31717443,Edward J.
