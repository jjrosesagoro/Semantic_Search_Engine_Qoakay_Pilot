Despite this, many systems are built with standard, predefined filter banks that are not optimized for that particular application. Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images. In both applications, a combination of learning objectives outperformed purely discriminative or generative learning, increasing, for instance, the lung tissue classification accuracy by 1 to 8 percentage points. This shows that discriminative learning can help an otherwise unsupervised feature learner to learn filters that are optimized for classification.",2016,47,97,3,True,Computer Science,51256193,Gijs van Tulder,32895376.0,Marleen de Bruijne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The notes are split into two parts. The first part focuses on the definition and fundamental properties of the signature of a path, or the path signature. We have aimed for a minimalistic approach, assuming only familiarity with classical real analysis and integration theory, and supplementing theory with straightforward examples. We have chosen to focus in detail on the principle properties of the signature which we believe are fundamental to understanding its role in applications. We also present an informal discussion on some of its deeper properties and briefly mention the role of the signature in rough paths theory, which we hope could serve as a light introduction to rough paths for the interested reader. The second part of these notes discusses practical applications of the path signature to the area of machine learning. The signature approach represents a non-parametric way for extraction of characteristic features from data. The data are converted into a multi-dimensional path by means of various embedding algorithms and then processed for computation of individual terms of the signature which summarise certain information contained in the data. The signature thus transforms raw data into a set of features which are used in machine learning tasks. We will review current progress in applications of signatures to machine learning problems.",2016,29,121,19,False,Mathematics,3029003,I. Chevyrev,3362051.0,A.

Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding, and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed. To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift. Also, concept drift related research directions are covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers in their understanding of research developments in the field of learning under concept drift.",2019,148,401,36,True,Computer Science,144864069,Jie Lu,1471737704.0,Anjin Liu,Mathematics,46279367.0,Fan Dong,2056183624.0,Feng Gu,143931014.0,João Gama,46266495.0,Guangquan Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PUFs use the inherent physical differences of every chip to either securely authenticate the chip or generate cryptographic keys without the need of nonvolatile memory. However, PUFs have shown to be vulnerable to model building attacks if the attacker has access to challenge and response pairs. In these model building attacks, machine learning is used to determine the internal parameters of the PUF to build an accurate software model. Nevertheless, PUFs are still a promising building block and several protocols and designs have been proposed that are believed to be resistant against machine learning attacks. In this paper, we take a closer look at two such protocols, one based on reverse fuzzy extractors and one based on pattern matching. We show that it is possible to attack these protocols using machine learning despite the fact that an attacker does not have access to direct challenge and response pairs. The introduced attacks demonstrate that even highly obfuscated responses can be used to attack PUF protocols. Hence, this paper shows that even protocols in which it would be computationally infeasible to compute enough challenge and response pairs for a direct machine learning attack can be attacked using machine learning.",2015,22,84,19,False,Computer Science,4277384,G.

For novice crowdfunding project creators, however, there are few resources to turn to for assistance in the planning of crowdfunding projects. We are building a tool for novice project creators to get feedback on their project designs. One component of this tool is a comparison to existing projects. As such, we have applied a variety of machine learning classifiers to learn the concept of a successful online crowdfunding project at the time of project launch. Currently our classifier can predict with roughly 68% accuracy, whether a project will be successful or not.

In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES ('Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS') which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.",2005,22,698,85,False,Mathematics,33652486,J.

We study distributed machine learning from a different motivation, where the information about the same samples, e.g., users and objects, are owned by several parities that wish to collaborate but do not want to share raw data with each other. We propose an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for such a feature distributed machine learning (FDML) problem, to jointly learn from distributed features, with theoretical convergence guarantees under bounded asynchrony. Our algorithm does not require sharing the original features or even local model parameters between parties, thus preserving the data locality. The system can also easily incorporate differential privacy mechanisms to preserve a higher level of privacy. We implement the FDML system in a parameter server architecture and compare our system with fully centralized learning (which violates data locality) and learning based on only local features, through extensive experiments performed on both a public data set a9a, and a large dataset of 5,000,000 records and 8700 decentralized features from three collaborating apps at Tencent including Tencent MyApp, Tecent QQ Browser and Tencent Mobile Safeguard.

GNNs combine node feature information with the graph structure by recursively passing neural messages along edges of the input graph. However, incorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex models and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we propose GnnExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any graph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GnnExplainer identifies a compact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a crucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GnnExplainer can generate consistent and concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate GnnExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures. Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms alternative baseline approaches by up to 43.0% in explanation accuracy.

Nowadays, the possibility of collecting a large amount of observations paves the way to the adoption of machine learn- ing techniques, i.e. techniques able to extract information and patterns from large datasets. The use of statistical techniques for side channel at- tacks is not new. Techniques like Template Based DPA have shown their eectiveness in recent years. However these techniques rely on paramet- ric assumptions and are often limited to small dimensionality setting, which limits their range of application. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques to relax such assumption and to deal with high dimensional feature vectors. For this purpose, we first formalize the problem of studying the relation between power consumption and encryption key as a supervised learning task. Then we compare and assess several classifiers and dimensionality reduction techniques in a real experimental setting.

Risk bounds for classification and regression rules that interpolate,"Many modern machine learning models are trained to achieve zero or near-zero training error in order to obtain near-optimal (but non-zero) test error. This phenomenon of strong generalization performance for ""overfitted"" / interpolated classifiers appears to be ubiquitous in high-dimensional data, having been observed in deep networks, kernel machines, boosting and random forests. Their performance is consistently robust even when the data contain large amounts of label noise. Very little theory is available to explain these observations. The vast majority of theoretical analyses of generalization allows for interpolation only when there is little or no label noise. This paper takes a step toward a theoretical foundation for interpolated classifiers by analyzing local interpolating schemes, including geometric simplicial interpolation algorithm and singularly weighted $k$-nearest neighbor schemes. Consistency or near-consistency is proved for these schemes in classification and regression problems. Moreover, the nearest neighbor schemes exhibit optimal rates under some standard statistical assumptions. Finally, this paper suggests a way to explain the phenomenon of adversarial examples, which are seemingly ubiquitous in modern machine learning, and also discusses some connections to kernel machines and random forests in the interpolated regime.",2018,56,198,18,False,Computer Science,145520115,Mikhail Belkin,143724861.0,Daniel J.

In recent years, it has been successfully applied to training deep machine learning models on massive datasets.

Regrettably, the required all-to-all communication among the processing units limits the performance of these efforts. This paper examines a new class of hardware accelerators for large-scale combinatorial optimization and deep learning based on memristive Boltzmann machines. A massively parallel, memory-centric hardware accelerator is proposed based on recently developed resistive RAM (RRAM) technology. The proposed accelerator exploits the electrical properties of RRAm to realize in situ, fine-grained parallel computation within memory arrays, thereby eliminating the need for exchanging data between the memory cells and the computational units. Two classical optimization problems, graph partitioning and boolean satisfiability, and a deep belief network application are mapped onto the proposed hardware. As compared to a multicore system, the proposed accelerator achieves 57x higher performance and 25x lower energy with virtually no loss in the quality of the solution to the optimization problems. The memristive accelerator is also compared against an RRAM based processing-in-memory (PIM) system, with respective performance and energy improvements of 6.89x and 5.2x.",2016,92,171,12,False,Computer Science,1797114,M.

It becomes immensely difficult and costly to provide Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems for most languages due to the paucity of expert translators to provide parallel data. Even if experts are present, it appears infeasible due to the impending costs. In this paper we propose Active Crowd Translation (ACT), a new paradigm where active learning and crowd-sourcing come together to enable automatic translation for low-resource language pairs. Active learning aims at reducing cost of label acquisition by prioritizing the most informative data for annotation, while crowd-sourcing reduces cost by using the power of the crowds to make do for the lack of expensive language experts. We experiment and compare our active learning strategies with strong baselines and see significant improvements in translation quality. Similarly, our experiments with crowd-sourcing on Mechanical Turk have shown that it is possible to create parallel corpora using non-experts and with sufficient quality assurance, a translation system that is trained using this corpus approaches expert quality.",2010,20,158,7,False,Computer Science,2582114,V.

This paper will focus on the development, the verification, and the significance of variable importance. Introduction A classical machine learner is developed by collecting samples of data to represent the entire population. This data set is usually subdivided into two or more dataset. Part of the dataset set is commonly use for developing the machine learner, and the remaining data is use for evaluation. Often this data set is imbalanced; the data consists of only a very small minority of the data. Imbalanced machine learners tend to perform poorly with the classification of fraud detection, network intrusion, rare disease diagnosing, etc [1, 2]. This is due to imbalanced sampling during developing the machine learner. During the testing phase these rare cases are unseen during the training phase and are usually misclassified. Leo Breiman, a statistician from University of California at Berkeley, developed a machine learning algorithm to improve classification of diverse data using random sampling and attributes selection. This project involved the implementation of Breiman’s random forest algorithm into Weka. Weka is a data mining software in development by The University of Waikato. Many features of the random forest algorithm have yet to be implemented into this software.",2005,4,93,5,False,Computer Science,47457355,F.

This has been demonstrated by unsupervised clustering of co-expressed genes and, more importantly, by supervised learning algorithms. Using prior knowledge, these algorithms can assign functional annotations based on more complex expression signatures found in existing functional classes. Previously, support vector machines (SVMs) and other machine-learning methods have been applied to a limited number of functional classes for this purpose. Here we present, for the first time, the comprehensive application of supervised neural networks (SNNs) for functional annotation. Our study is novel in that we report systematic results for ~100 classes in the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) functional catalog. We found that only ~10% of these are learnable (based on the rate of false negatives). A closer analysis reveals that false positives (and negatives) in a machine-learning context are not necessarily ""false"" in a biological sense. We show that the high degree of interconnections among functional classes confounds the signatures that ought to be learned for a unique class. We term this the ""Borges effect"" and introduce two new numerical indices for its quantification. Our analysis indicates that classification systems with a lower Borges effect are better suitable for machine learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learning procedure for combining false positives with the original class. We show that in a few iterations this process converges to a gene set that is learnable with considerably low rates of false positives and negatives and contains genes that are biologically related to the original class, allowing for a coarse reconstruction of the interactions between associated biological pathways. We exemplify this methodology using the well-studied tricarboxylic acid cycle.",2002,36,134,4,True,Biology,121570730,Á. Mateos,145909087.0,J. Dopazo,Medicine,144322209.0,R. Jansen,145817287.0,Y.

In the smart grid, the overall monitoring costs will be decreased, but at the same time, the risk of cyber attacks might be increased. Recently, a new type of attacks (called the stealth attack) has been introduced, which cannot be detected by the traditional bad data detection using state estimation. In this paper, we show how normal operations of power networks can be statistically distinguished from the case under stealthy attacks. We propose two machine-learning-based techniques for stealthy attack detection. The first method utilizes supervised learning over labeled data and trains a distributed support vector machine (SVM). The design of the distributed SVM is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which offers provable optimality and convergence rate. The second method requires no training data and detects the deviation in measurements. In both methods, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to be processed, which leads to lower computation complexities. The results of the proposed detection methods on IEEE standard test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of both schemes.",2013,44,312,21,False,Computer Science,1684409,Mohammad Esmalifalak,2116204721.0,Lanchao Liu,Engineering,1845448.0,N.

We design a reinforcement learning algorithm in which the set of visible nodes representing the states and actions of an optimal policy are the first and last layers of the deep network.

Different algorithms respect to different set of fixed point constraints, so instead of using these traditional algorithms, can we learn an algorithm which can obtain the same steady-state solutions automatically from examples, in an effective and scalable way? How to represent the meta learner for such algorithm and how to carry out the learning? In this paper, we propose an embedding representation for iterative algorithms over graphs, and design a learning method which alternates between updating the embeddings and projecting them onto the steadystate constraints.

New machine learning algorithms have emerged in the last years, but so far, few studies only have compared their performance and usability. Therefore, we compared three different state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) as well as the traditional classification method Maximum Likelihood (ML) among each other. For this purpose we classified a dataset of more than 500 crop fields located in the Canadian Prairies with a stratified randomized sampling approach. Up to four multi-spectral RapidEye images from the 2009 growing season were used. We compared the mean overall classification accuracies as well as standard deviations. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of single crops was analysed. Support Vector Machine classifiers using radial basis function or polynomial kernels exhibited superior results to ANN and RF in terms of overall accuracy and robustness, while ML exhibited inferior accuracies and higher variability. Grassland exhibited the best results for early-season mono-temporal analysis. With a multi-temporal approach, the highest accuracies were achieved for Rapeseed and Field Peas. Other crops, such as Wheat, Flax and Lentils were also successfully classified. The user’s and producer’s accuracies were higher than 85 %.",2012,17,152,4,False,Engineering,3172845,I.

On the other hand, the performance of traditional and widely used statistical classification methods is often limited in this context, and thus alternative methods are required. In the study presented here, the performance of two machine-learning techniques, namely support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs), is investigated and the classification results are compared with those from well-known methods (i.e., maximum likelihood classifier and spectral angle mapper). The classifiers are applied to an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) dataset that was acquired near the Hekla volcano in Iceland. The results clearly show the advantages of the two proposed classifier algorithms in terms of accuracy. They significantly outperform the other methods and achieve overall accuracies of approximately 90%. Although SVM and RF show some diversity in the classification results, the global performance of the two classifiers is very similar.

The convexity makes these algorithms computationally efficient. The use of a surrogate, however, has statistical consequences that must be balanced against the computational virtues of convexity. To study these issues, we provide a general quantitative relationship between the risk as assessed using the 0–1 loss and the risk as assessed using any nonnegative surrogate loss function. We show that this relationship gives nontrivial upper bounds on excess risk under the weakest possible condition on the loss function—that it satisfies a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classification. The relationship is based on a simple variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications. We also present a refined version of this result in the case of low noise, and show that in this case, strictly convex loss functions lead to faster rates of convergence of the risk than would be implied by standard uniform convergence arguments. Finally, we present applications of our results to the estimation of convergence rates in function classes that are scaled convex hulls of a finite-dimensional base class, with a variety of commonly used loss functions.",2006,81,1245,184,True,Mathematics,1745169,P.

However, the networks continue to be treated mostly as black-box function approximators, mapping a given input to a classification output. The next step in this human-machine evolutionary process — incorporating these networks into mission critical processes such as medical diagnosis, planning and control — requires a level of trust association with the machine output. Typically, statistical metrics are used to quantify the uncertainty of an output. However, the notion of trust also depends on the visibility that a human has into the working of the machine. In other words, the neural network should provide human-understandable justifications for its output leading to insights about the inner workings. We call such models as interpretable deep networks. Interpretability is not a monolithic notion. In fact, the subjectivity of an interpretation, due to different levels of human understanding, implies that there must be a multitude of dimensions that together constitute interpretability. In addition, the interpretation itself can be provided either in terms of the low-level network parameters, or in terms of input features used by the model. In this paper, we outline some of the dimensions that are useful for model interpretability, and categorize prior work along those dimensions. In the process, we perform a gap analysis of what needs to be done to improve model interpretability.",2017,47,241,11,True,Computer Science,144387904,Supriyo Chakraborty,50998197.0,Richard J.

Accurate prediction of stroke is highly valuable for early intervention and treatment. In this study, we compare the Cox proportional hazards model with a machine learning approach for stroke prediction on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) dataset. Specifically, we consider the common problems of data imputation, feature selection, and prediction in medical datasets. We propose a novel automatic feature selection algorithm that selects robust features based on our proposed heuristic: conservative mean. Combined with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), our proposed feature selection algorithm achieves a greater area under the ROC curve (AUC) as compared to the Cox proportional hazards model and L1 regularized Cox feature selection algorithm. Furthermore, we present a margin-based censored regression algorithm that combines the concept of margin-based classifiers with censored regression to achieve a better concordance index than the Cox model. Overall, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both metrics of AUC and concordance index. In addition, our work has also identified potential risk factors that have not been discovered by traditional approaches.

Most classifiers are designed so as to learn from the data itself using a training process, because complete expert knowledge to determine classifier parameters is impracticable. This paper proposes a hybrid methodology based on machine learning paradigm. This paradigm integrates the successful exploration mechanism called self-regulated learning capability of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. As a recent off-line learning method, ELM is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (FFNN), proved to be an excellent classifier with large number of hidden layer neurons. In this research, PSO is used to determine the optimum set of parameters for the ELM, thus reducing the number of hidden layer neurons, and it further improves the network generalization performance. The proposed method is experimented on five benchmarked datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository for handling medical dataset classification. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve good generalization performance, compared to the results of other classifiers.",2015,38,59,3,True,Computer Science,33719529,C.

The majority of these algorithms can be applied only to data described by discrete numerical or nominal attributes (features). In the case of continuous attributes, there is a need for a discretization algorithm that transforms continuous attributes into discrete ones. We describe such an algorithm, called CAIM (class-attribute interdependence maximization), which is designed to work with supervised data. The goal of the CAIM algorithm is to maximize the class-attribute interdependence and to generate a (possibly) minimal number of discrete intervals. The algorithm does not require the user to predefine the number of intervals, as opposed to some other discretization algorithms. The tests performed using CAIM and six other state-of-the-art discretization algorithms show that discrete attributes generated by the CAIM algorithm almost always have the lowest number of intervals and the highest class-attribute interdependency. Two machine learning algorithms, the CLIP4 rule algorithm and the decision tree algorithm, are used to generate classification rules from data discretized by CAIM. For both the CLIP4 and decision tree algorithms, the accuracy of the generated rules is higher and the number of the rules is lower for data discretized using the CAIM algorithm when compared to data discretized using six other discretization algorithms.

Because such models are sometimes trained on sensitive data (e.g., the text of users' private messages), this methodology can benefit privacy by allowing deep-learning practitioners to select means of training that minimize such memorization. 
In experiments, we show that unintended memorization is a persistent, hard-to-avoid issue that can have serious consequences. Specifically, for models trained without consideration of memorization, we describe new, efficient procedures that can extract unique, secret sequences, such as credit card numbers. We show that our testing strategy is a practical and easy-to-use first line of defense, e.g., by describing its application to quantitatively limit data exposure in Google's Smart Compose, a commercial text-completion neural network trained on millions of users' email messages.",2018,69,487,46,False,Computer Science,2483738,Nicholas Carlini,2118484320.0,Chang Liu,,1758110.0,Ú.

Arrhythmic beat classification is mainly used in electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality detection for identifying heart related problems. In this paper, ECG signal preprocessing and support vector machine-based arrhythmic beat classification are performed to categorize into normal and abnormal subjects. In ECG signal preprocessing, a delayed error normalized LMS adaptive filter is used to achieve high speed and low latency design with less computational elements. Since the signal processing technique is developed for remote healthcare systems, white noise removal is mainly focused. Discrete wavelet transform is applied on the preprocessed signal for HRV feature extraction and machine learning techniques are used for performing arrhythmic beat classification. In this paper, SVM classifier and other popular classifiers have been used on noise removed feature extracted signal for beat classification.

This is done in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to subdifferentials: the local quadratic model, the identification of a descent direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We prove that under some technical conditions, the resulting subBFGS algorithm is globally convergent in objective function value. We apply its memory-limited variant (subLBFGS) to L2-regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss. To extend our algorithm to the multiclass and multilabel settings, we develop a new, efficient, exact line search algorithm. We prove its worst-case time complexity bounds, and show that our line search can also be used to extend a recently developed bundle method to the multiclass and multilabel settings. We also apply the direction-finding component of our algorithm to L1-regularized risk minimization with logistic loss.

While image-level classification has been extensively studied in a semi-supervised setting, dense pixel-level classification with limited data has only drawn attention recently. In this work, we propose an approach for semi-supervised semantic segmentation that learns from limited pixel-wise annotated samples while exploiting additional annotation-free images. The proposed approach relies on adversarial training with a feature matching loss to learn from unlabeled images. It uses two network branches that link semi-supervised classification with semi-supervised segmentation including self-training. The dual-branch approach reduces both the low-level and the high-level artifacts typical when training with few labels. The approach attains significant improvement over existing methods, especially when trained with very few labeled samples.

Widely used short-term-average long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) based arrival picking algorithms suffer from the sensitivity to moderate-to-strong random ambient noise. To make the state-of-the-art arrival picking approaches effective, microseismic data need to be first pre-processed, for example, removing sufficient amount of noise, and second analysed by arrival pickers. To conquer the noise issue in arrival picking for weak microseismic or earthquake event, I leverage the machine learning techniques to help recognizing seismic waveforms in microseismic or earthquake data. Because of the dependency of supervised machine learning algorithm on large volume of well-designed training data, I utilize an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to help cluster the time samples into two groups, that is, waveform points and non-waveform points. The fuzzy clustering algorithm has been demonstrated to be effective for such purpose. A group of synthetic, real microseismic and earthquake data sets with different levels of complexity show that the proposed method is much more robust than the state-of-the-art STA/LTA method in picking microseismic events, even in the case of moderately strong background noise.",2020,81,117,0,True,Computer Science,2860323,Yangkang Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treat it as a multitask learning problem where each task corresponds to a single word, and task relatedness is derived from co-occurrence statistics in bilingual parallel data. These representations can be used for a number of crosslingual learning tasks, where a learner can be trained on annotations present in one language and applied to test data in another.

From the supplier side, particularly, the integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) into the grid imposes an engineering and economic challenge because of the limited ability to control and dispatch these energy sources due to their intermittent characteristics. Time-series prediction of wind speed for wind power production is a particularly important and challenging task, wherein prediction intervals (PIs) are preferable results of the prediction, rather than point estimates, because they provide information on the confidence in the prediction. In this paper, two different machine learning approaches to assess PIs of time-series predictions are considered and compared: 1) multilayer perceptron neural networks trained with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and 2) extreme learning machines combined with the nearest neighbors approach.

However, machine learning evolved in a different research context to that in which it now finds itself employed. A particularly important problem in the data mining world is working effectively with large data sets. However, most machine learning research has been conducted in the context of learning from very small data sets. To date most approaches to scaling up machine learning to large data sets have attempted to modify existing algorithms to deal with large data sets in a more computationally efficient and effective manner. But is this necessarily the best method? This paper explores the possibility of designing algorithms specifically for large data sets. Specifically, the paper looks at how increasing data set size affects bias and variance error decompositions for classification algorithms. Preliminary results of experiments to determine these effects are presented, showing that, as hypothesised variance can be expected to decrease as training set size increases. No clear effect of training set size on bias was observed. These results have profound implications for data mining from large data sets, indicating that developing effective learning algorithms for large data sets is not simply a matter of finding computationally efficient variants of existing learning algorithms.",1999,14,83,2,False,Computer Science,144836106,Damien Brain,1726660.0,Geoffrey I.

Third, the input stream should be processed by a single generic NMT model. To tackle the weaknesses of current NMT technology in this unsupervised multi-domain setting, we explore an efficient instance-based adaptation method that, by exploiting the similarity between the training instances and each test sentence, dynamically sets the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm and updates the generic model on-the-fly.

Most work has focused on classiication in static domains, where an instantaneous snapshot of attributes is meaningful. In many domains, attributes are not static; in fact, it is the way they vary temporally that can make classiication possible. Examples of such domains include speech recognition, gesture recognition and electrocardiograph clas-siication. While it is possible to use ad hoc, domain-speciic techniques for \\atten-ing"" the time series to a learner-friendly representation , this fails to take into account both the special problems and special heuris-tics applicable to temporal data and often results in unreadable concept descriptions. Though traditional time series techniques can sometimes produce accurate classiiers, few can provide comprehensible descriptions. We propose a general architecture for classiica-tion and description of multivariate time series. It employs event primitives to analyse the training data and extract events. These events are clustered, creating proto-typical events which are used as the basis for creating more accurate and comprehensi-ble classiiers. A minimal implementation of this architecture, called TClass, is applied to two domains, one real and one artiicial and compared against a na ve approach. TClass shows great promise, particularly in compre-hensibility, but also in accuracy.",1999,23,125,14,False,Computer Science,1793159,M. W.

This paper presents a comparison of parametric (Multiple Linear Regression, Generalized Linear Models) and machine learning (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) regression models for predicting overstorey FPC from Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. Estimates of overstorey FPC were derived from field measured stand basal area (RMSE 7.26%) for calibration of the regression models. Independent estimates of overstorey FPC were derived from field and airborne LiDAR (RMSE 5.34%) surveys for validation of model predictions. The airborne LiDAR-derived estimates of overstorey FPC enabled the bias and variance of model predictions to be quantified in regional areas. The results showed all the parametric and machine learning models had similar prediction errors (RMSE < 10%), but the machine learning models had less bias than the parametric models at greater than ~60% overstorey FPC. All models showed greater than 10% bias in plant communities with high herbaceous or understorey FPC. The results of this work indicate that use of overstorey FPC products derived from Landsat-5 TM or Landsat-7 ETM+ data in Queensland using any of the regression models requires the assumption of senescent or absent herbaceous foliage at the time of image acquisition.",2009,75,136,9,False,Mathematics,88709668,J.

Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson's disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security.

Data‐driven methods such as machine learning are especially suited to systems with governing functions that are unknown, impractical or impossible to represent analytically, or computationally intractable to integrate into real‐world solutions. Function approximation with careful formulation of the machine learning architecture enables the encoding of dynamic behavior and nonlinearities, with the added potential to address hysteresis and nonstationary behavior.

The objective of this study was to apply machine learning techniques to automatically identify high-quality, content-specific articles for one time period in internal medicine and compare their performance with previous Boolean-based PubMed clinical query filters of Haynes et al. DESIGN The selection criteria of the ACP Journal Club for articles in internal medicine were the basis for identifying high-quality articles in the areas of etiology, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. Naive Bayes, a specialized AdaBoost algorithm, and linear and polynomial support vector machines were applied to identify these articles. MEASUREMENTS The machine learning models were compared in each category with each other and with the clinical query filters using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, 11-point average recall precision, and a sensitivity/specificity match method. RESULTS In most categories, the data-induced models have better or comparable sensitivity, specificity, and precision than the clinical query filters. The polynomial support vector machine models perform the best among all learning methods in ranking the articles as evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve and 11-point average recall precision. CONCLUSION This research shows that, using machine learning methods, it is possible to automatically build models for retrieving high-quality, content-specific articles using inclusion or citation by the ACP Journal Club as a gold standard in a given time period in internal medicine that perform better than the 1994 PubMed clinical query filters.",2004,42,131,4,True,Computer Science,8340776,Yindalon Aphinyanagphongs,3032369.0,I.

As is usually the case where computer systems are involved, the new generation is several orders of magnitude more powerful than even its remarkably mind-extending parent. The last few years have represented a ""passing from an idiom to a reality, following (not necessarily consciously) notions set down in ""The Architecture Machine"" with an uncanny precision. The prognostications of hardware enumerated in wanton fantasy have been achieved and even superseded in the actual Architecture Machine of 1972.""The general assumption of this new book is that the architect is an unnecessary and even detrimental middleman between individual, continuously changing needs and the continuous incorporation of those needs into the built environment. The book proposes a new kind of architecture without architects, and even without surrogate architects.The first chapter sets forth generally what is involved in learning to understand both the makings of intelligence and the making of architecture. It reveals polarities in attitudes toward thinking about thinking, and it appraises techniques--real and potential--that lead to meaningful thought about the process.A more direct analysis of architectural design activities is presented in the second chapter. Its goal is to achieve a closer coupling between man and machine, and it proposes sidestepping the traditional division of labor in which man and machine are assigned tasks that they are supposed to be respectively better at. Instead, a joint venture model is suggested: man and machine are treated as equal partners, even as candid good friends.The third chapter moves beyond the architect--beyond the need for an outside designer's intervention between our needs and their fulfillment. It asserts that each individual can be the best architect for his own needs and does not require a paternalistic human or mechanical architect to dictate his final decisions.The last chapter--furthest out of all--looks toward a distant future not only beyond the architect but beyond architecture as we know it. Here architecture machines are not simply used as aids in the design of buildings--they serve as buildings in themselves. Man will live in living, intelligent machines or cognitive physical environments that can immediately respond to his needs or wishes or whims. The possibilities are unlimited and a challenge to any imagination.",1976,0,292,8,False,Engineering,2687459,N.

The tensor core unit (TPU) has shown to outperform graphic process units by almost 3-orders of magnitude enabled by higher signal throughout and energy efficiency. In this context, photons bear a number of synergistic physical properties while phase-change materials allow for local nonvolatile mnemonic functionality in these emerging distributed non van-Neumann architectures. While several photonic neural network designs have been explored, a photonic TPU to perform matrix vector multiplication and summation is yet outstanding. Here we introduced an integrated photonics-based TPU by strategically utilizing a) photonic parallelism via wavelength division multiplexing, b) high 2 Peta-operations-per second throughputs enabled by 10s of picosecond-short delays from optoelectronics and compact photonic integrated circuitry, and c) zero power-consuming novel photonic multi-state memories based on phase-change materials featuring vanishing losses in the amorphous state. Combining these physical synergies of material, function, and system, we show that the performance of this 8-bit photonic TPU can be 2-3 orders higher compared to an electrical TPU whilst featuring similar chip areas. This work shows that photonic specialized processors have the potential to augment electronic systems and may perform exceptionally well in network-edge devices in the looming 5G networks and beyond.",2020,45,90,5,True,Computer Science,50533784,M.
