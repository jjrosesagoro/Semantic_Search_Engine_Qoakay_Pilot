We propose the first learning algorithms in this model with implication counter-examples that are based on machine learning techniques. In particular, we extend classical decision-tree learning algorithms in machine learning to handle implication samples, building new scalable ways to construct small decision trees using statistical measures. We also develop a decision-tree learning algorithm in this model that is guaranteed to converge to the right concept (invariant) if one exists. We implement the learners and an appropriate teacher, and show that the resulting invariant synthesis is efficient and convergent for a large suite of programs.",2016,85,161,20,True,Computer Science,1802463,P.

Growing datasets provide a sound basis with which to apply machine learning methods that learn from previous experiences. This review explains the basics of machine learning and its subfields of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning. We provide an overview of current machine learning applications in rheumatology, mainly supervised learning methods for e-diagnosis, disease detection and medical image analysis. In the future, machine learning will be likely to assist rheumatologists in predicting the course of the disease and identifying important disease factors. Even more interestingly, machine learning will probably be able to make treatment propositions and estimate their expected benefit (e.g. by reinforcement learning).

This article describes recent advances in our understanding of the theoretical benefits of active learning, and implications for the design of effective active learning algorithms. Much of the article focuses on a particular technique, namely disagreement-based active learning, which by now has amassed a mature and coherent literature.

Here we develop CRAIG, a method to select a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data that closely estimates the full gradient by maximizing a submodular function. We prove that applying IG to this subset is guaranteed to converge to the (near)optimal solution with the same convergence rate as that of IG for convex optimization. As a result, CRAIG achieves a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of the subset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous method for data-efficient training of general machine learning models.

In the proposed model, the parameters are compressed significantly by converting the weight matrices to the canonical polyadic format. Furthermore, an efficient learning algorithm is designed to train the parameters.

Our unsupervised approach uses an Expectation Max- imization (EM) based clustering algorithm and the supervised approach uses the NaBayes classifier. We find the unsu- pervised clustering technique has an accuracy up to 91% and outperform the supervised technique by up to 9%. We also find that the unsupervised technique can be used to discover traffic from previously unknown applications and has the potential to become an excellent tool for exploring Internet traffic. I. INTRODUCTION Accurate classification of Internet traffic is important in many areas such as network design, network management, and network security. One key challenge in this area is to adapt to the dynamic nature of Internet traffic. Increasingly, new applications are being deployed on the Internet; some new applications such as peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and online gaming are becoming popular. With the evolution of Internet traffic, both in terms of number and type of applications, however, traditional classification techniques such as those based on well-known port numbers or packet payload analysis are either no longer effective for all types of network traffic or are otherwise unable to deploy because of privacy or security concerns for the data. A promising approach that has recently received some attention is traffic classification using machine learning tech- niques (1)-(4). These approaches assume that the applications typically send data in some sort of pattern; these patterns can be used as a means of identification which would allow the connections to be classified by traffic class. To find these patterns, flow statistics (such as mean packet size, flow length, and total number of packets) available using only TCP/IP headers are needed. This allows the classification technique to avoid the use of port numbers and packet payload information in the classification process. In this paper, we apply an unsupervised learning technique (EM clustering) for the Internet traffic classification problem and compare the results with that of a previously applied supervised machine learning approach. The unsupervised clus- tering approach uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) algo- rithm (5) that is different in that it classifies unlabeled training data into groups called ""clusters"" based on similarity. The NaBayes classifier has been previously shown to have high accuracy for Internet traffic classification (2). In parallel work, Zander et al. focus on using the EM clustering approach to build the classification model (4). We complement their work by using the EM clustering approach to build a classifier and show that this classifier outperforms the Na¨ Bayes classifier in terms of classification accuracy. We also analyze the time required to build the classification models for both approaches as a function of the size of the training data set. We also explore the clusters found by the EM approach and find that the majority of the connections are in a subset of the total clusters. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents related work. In Section III, the background on the algorithms used in the Na¨ive Bayes and EM clustering approaches are covered. In Section IV, we introduce the data sets used in our work and present our experimental results. Section V discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches.

However, to predict new regions of the potential energy surface, an assessment must be made of the credibility of the predictions. In this perspective, we address the types of errors that might arise in atomistic machine learning, the unique aspects of atomistic simulations that make machine-learning challenging, and highlight how uncertainty analysis can be used to assess the validity of machine-learning predictions. We suggest this will allow researchers to more fully use machine learning for the routine acceleration of large, high-accuracy, or extended-time simulations. In our demonstrations, we use a bootstrap ensemble of neural network-based calculators, and show that the width of the ensemble can provide an estimate of the uncertainty when the width is comparable to that in the training data. Intriguingly, we also show that the uncertainty can be localized to specific atoms in the simulation, which may offer hints for the generation of training data to strategically improve the machine-learned representation.",2017,32,90,1,True,Medicine,34641730,A.

In this work, we deal with space-invariant non-blind deconvolution. Currently, the most successful methods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step approach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network. We will show that this approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on a large dataset of artificially blurred images.

The principle conclusion of these experiments was that VEGA provided a powerful and robust search technique for complex multiobjective optimization problems of high order when little or no a priori knowledge was available to guide the search. These results were similar to those found by previous researchers using scalar genetic algorithms for scalar optimization problems. The VEGA technique was then applied to multiclass pattern discrimination tasks. The resulting software system was called LS-2 for Learning System - Two since it followed closely the lead of a scalar-valued learning system called LS-1 developed by Stephen Smith. The experiments revealed that LS-2 was able to evolve high performance production system programs to perform the pattern discrimination tasks it was given. In addition, experiments which varied several of the parameters of LS-2 revealed something of the sensitivity of vector-valued genetic search to the settings of these parameters.

The paper describes computer experiments, using the author's 4341 line LISP program, in five areas of artifical intelligence, namely (1) sequence induction (e.g. inducing a computational procedure for the recursive Fibonacci sequence and inducing a computational procedure for a cubic polynomial sequence), (2) automatic programming (e.g. discovering a computational procedure for solving pairs of linear equations, solving quadratic equations for complex roots, and discovering trigonometric identities), (3) machine learning of functions (e.g. learning a Boolean multiplexer function previously studied in neural net and classifier system work and learning the exclusive-or and parity function), (4) planning (e.g. developing a robotic action sequence that can stack an arbitrary initial configuration of blocks into a specified order), and (5) pattern recognition (e.g. translation-invariant recognition of a simple one dimensional shape in a linear retina).",1989,20,377,19,False,Computer Science,1732302,J.

Automatically detecting falls can allow rapid response to potential emergencies; in addition, knowing the cause or manner of a fall can be beneficial for prevention studies or a more tailored emergency response. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate techniques to not only reliably detect a fall but also to automatically classify the type. We asked 15 subjects to simulate four different types of falls–left and right lateral, forward trips, and backward slips–while wearing mobile phones and previously validated, dedicated accelerometers. Nine subjects also wore the devices for ten days, to provide data for comparison with the simulated falls. We applied five machine learning classifiers to a large time-series feature set to detect falls. Support vector machines and regularized logistic regression were able to identify a fall with 98% accuracy and classify the type of fall with 99% accuracy. This work demonstrates how current machine learning approaches can simplify data collection for prevention in fall-related research as well as improve rapid response to potential injuries due to falls.",2012,37,191,9,True,Medicine,3182510,Mark V.

Recently, the machine-learning-based VADs have shown a superiority to traditional VADs on multiple feature fusion tasks. However, existing machine-learning-based VADs only utilize shallow models, which cannot explore the underlying manifold of the features. In this paper, we propose to fuse multiple features via a deep model, called deep belief network (DBN). DBN is a powerful hierarchical generative model for feature extraction. It can describe highly variant functions and discover the manifold of the features. We take the multiple serially-concatenated features as the input layer of DBN, and then extract a new feature by transferring these features through multiple nonlinear hidden layers. Finally, we predict the class of the new feature by a linear classifier. We further analyze that even a single-hidden-layer-based belief network is as powerful as the state-of-the-art models in the machine-learning-based VADs. In our empirical comparison, ten common features are used for performance analysis. Extensive experimental results on the AURORA2 corpus show that the DBN-based VAD not only outperforms eleven referenced VADs, but also can meet the real-time detection demand of VAD. The results also show that the DBN-based VAD can fuse the advantages of multiple features effectively.",2013,80,295,19,True,Computer Science,2118044484,Xiao-Lei Zhang,2130527774.0,Ji Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reviewing the results of ANN and SVM indicated that both models have suitable performance for predicting water quality components. During the process of development of ANN and SVM, it was found that tansig and RBF as transfer and kernel functions have the best performance among the tested functions. Comparison of outcomes of GMDH model with other applied models shows that although this model has acceptable performance for predicting the components of water quality, its accuracy is slightly less than ANN and SVM. The evaluation of the accuracy of the applied models according to the error indexes declared that SVM was the most accurate model. Examining the results of the models showed that all of them had some over-estimation properties.

In particular it is well known that regularization schemes such as Tikhonov regularization can be effectively used in the context of learning and are closely related to algorithms such as support vector machines. Nevertheless the connection with inverse problem was considered only for the discrete (finite sample) problem and the probabilistic aspects of learning from examples were not taken into account. In this paper we provide a natural extension of such analysis to the continuous (population) case and study the interplay between the discrete and continuous problems. From a theoretical point of view, this allows to draw a clear connection between the consistency approach in learning theory and the stability convergence property in ill-posed inverse problems. The main mathematical result of the paper is a new probabilistic bound for the regularized least-squares algorithm.

A Theoretical Assessment (Part II),"An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two-stage feed-forward neural network (FNN) learning system that randomly assigns the connections with and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections with output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that whether this is true in theory. The aim of this paper is to study the theoretical feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part of this topic, we pointed out that via appropriately selected activation functions, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the sense of expectation. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically justify that there also exist activation functions such that the corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential characteristic of ELM in a certain sense and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.",2014,67,104,1,True,Computer Science,2432506,Shaobo Lin,2110880625.0,Xia Liu,2115378715.0,Jian Fang,98220533.0,Zongben Xu,,,,,,,Medicine,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,

Federated learning is a popular learning mechanism, where multiple parties upload local gradients to a server and the server updates model parameters with the collected gradients. However, there are many security problems neglected in federated learning, for example, the participants may behave incorrectly in gradient collecting or parameter updating, and the server may be malicious as well.

These rates are in terms of two assumptions on the considered distributions: Tsybakov’s noise assumption to establish a small estimation error, and a new geometric noise condition which is used to bound the approximation error. Unlike previously proposed concepts for bounding the approximation error, the geometric noise assumption does not employ any smoothness assumption. 1. Introduction. In recent years support vector machines (SVMs) have been the subject of many theoretical considerations. Despite this effort, their learning performance on restricted classes of distributions is still widely unknown. In particular, it is unknown under which nontrivial circumstances SVMs can guarantee fast learning rates. The aim of this work is to use concepts like Tsybakov’s noise assumption and local Rademacher averages to establish learning rates up to the order of n −1 for nontrivial distributions. In addition to these concepts that are used to deal with the stochastic part of the analysis we also introduce a geometric assumption for distributions that allows us to estimate the approximation properties of Gaussian RBF kernels. Unlike many other concepts introduced for bounding the approximation error, our geometric assumption is not in terms of smoothness but describes the concentration and the noisiness of the data-generating distribution near the decision boundary. Let us formally introduce the statistical classification problem. To this end let us fix a subset X ⊂ R d . We write Y := {−1,1}.

Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data.

Most previous works designed adaptive classifiers by exploring two learning strategies independently: distribution adaptation and label propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as Adaptation Regularization based Transfer Learning (ARTL), to model them in a unified way based on the structural risk minimization principle and the regularization theory. Specifically, ARTL learns the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, the joint distribution matching between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. Based on the framework, we propose two novel methods using Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), respectively, and use the Representer theorem in reproducing kernel Hilbert space to derive corresponding solutions.

Computational complexity considerations of the quantum sampling problem suggest that the quantum circuits exhibit stronger expressibility compared to classical neural networks. One can efficiently draw samples from the quantum circuits via projective measurements on qubits. However, similar to the leading implicit generative models in deep learning, such as the generative adversarial networks, the quantum circuits cannot provide the likelihood of the generated samples, which poses a challenge to the training. We devise an efficient gradient-based learning algorithm for the quantum circuit Born machine by minimizing the kerneled maximum mean discrepancy loss. We simulated generative modeling of the BARS-AND-STRIPES dataset and Gaussian mixture distributions using deep quantum circuits.

The semantic orientation of a review can be positive, negative, or neutral. We examine the effect of valence shifters on classifying the reviews. We examine three types of valence shifters: negations, intensifiers, and diminishers. Negations are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, while intensifiers and diminishers are used to increase and decrease, respectively, the degree to which a term is positive or negative. The first method classifies reviews based on the number of positive and negative terms they contain. We use the General Inquirer to identify positive and negative terms, as well as negation terms, intensifiers, and diminishers. We also use positive and negative terms from other sources, including a dictionary of synonym differences and a very large Web corpus. To compute corpus‐based semantic orientation values of terms, we use their association scores with a small group of positive and negative terms. We show that extending the term‐counting method with contextual valence shifters improves the accuracy of the classification. The second method uses a Machine Learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines. We start with unigram features and then add bigrams that consist of a valence shifter and another word. The accuracy of classification is very high, and the valence shifter bigrams slightly improve it. The features that contribute to the high accuracy are the words in the lists of positive and negative terms. Previous work focused on either the term‐counting method or the Machine Learning method.

However, due to the time and cost of human labor, solutions that rely solely on crowd-sourcing are often limited to small datasets (i.e., a few thousand items). This paper proposes algorithms for integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases in order to combine the accuracy of human labeling with the speed and cost-effectiveness of machine learning classifiers. By using active learning as our optimization strategy for labeling tasks in crowd-sourced databases, we can minimize the number of questions asked to the crowd, allowing crowd-sourced applications to scale (i.e., label much larger datasets at lower costs). Designing active learning algorithms for a crowd-sourced database poses many practical challenges: such algorithms need to be generic, scalable, and easy to use, even for practitioners who are not machine learning experts. We draw on the theory of nonparametric bootstrap to design, to the best of our knowledge, the first active learning algorithms that meet all these requirements.

First, doublets and triplets are constructed from the training samples, and a family of degree-2 polynomial kernel functions is proposed for pairs of doublets or triplets. Then, a kernel classification framework is established to generalize many popular metric learning methods such as LMNN and ITML. The proposed framework can also suggest new metric learning methods, which can be efficiently implemented, interestingly, using the standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers.

Machine learning models can be used to predict compounds for endocrine disrupting capabilities, such as binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), and allow for prioritization and further testing. In this work, an exhaustive comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, chemical spaces, and evaluation metrics for ER binding was performed on public data sets curated using in-house cheminformatics software (Assay Central). Chemical features utilized in modeling consisted of binary fingerprints (ECFP6, FCFP6, ToxPrint, or MACCS keys) and continuous molecular descriptors from RDKit. Each feature set was subjected to classic machine learning algorithms (Bernoulli Naive Bayes, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Models were evaluated using a variety of metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Cohen's Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient. For predicting compounds within the training set, DNN has an accuracy higher than that of other methods; however, in 5-fold cross validation and external test set predictions, DNN and most classic machine learning models perform similarly regardless of the data set or molecular descriptors used. We have also used the rank normalized scores as a performance-criteria for each machine learning method, and Random Forest performed best on the validation set when ranked by metric or by data sets. These results suggest classic machine learning algorithms may be sufficient to develop high quality predictive models of ER activity.",2018,79,87,0,True,Medicine,8903363,Daniel P.

Recent developments in a branch of machine learning known as deep learning have catalyzed impressive gains in machine vision-giving a sense that the problem of vision is getting closer to being solved. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent deep learning developments and to critically assess actual progress toward achieving human-level visual intelligence. I discuss the implications of the successes and limitations of modern machine vision algorithms for biological vision and the prospect for neuroscience to inform the design of future artificial vision systems.

Since GMRF’s can be specified through Normal conditionals defined by sparse matrices, this allows certain computations to run much more quickly than they would in the case of methods based on the dense matrix . Throughout the book, Normal distributions are specified by precisions, rather than by variances. The authors assume that the reader has a good working knowledge of conditional probability and of the multivariate Normal distribution at the level of Hogg, McKean, and Craig (2005). Beyond this, they outline or discuss in detail the technical aspects of fitting GMRF’s, with a strong emphasis on only those details that are needed to make practical use of the methods. More formal and mathematical results are referenced in the endnotes. Their style is terse and if some detail seems to be missing, it can often be found upon rereading. If not, then the references and endnotes will point to where those details can be found. Theory is usually presented first, followed by a detailed investigation of one or more complex examples. After a brief and very useful introduction, Chapter 2 contains most of the general results about GMRF’s. It begins with a presentation of notation necessary to describe conditional distributions relative to graphical dependence networks. The use of the precision matrix in model specification, inference, and simulation is then discussed, and a section is dedicated to a general review of solvers for sparse systems of linear equations. Since the speed of precisionmatrix-based methods depends on the speed of these solvers, this discussion is central to the practical use of these methods, and any text on inference that requires these methods should include a section of this kind. The use of toroidal boundary conditions on the data is discussed, showing how they can lead to further speed increases through use of cyclic precision matrices. Finally, several methods for ensuring that Q is positive definite are compared. The three remaining chapters apply the basic techniques to increasingly complex models. Whereas the third chapter is accessible and self-contained, the authors admit that the last two chapters cover areas where research is ongoing and suggest that they are best used by those with prior knowledge of those areas. Chapter 3 presents GMRF’s in which Q is not of full rank. This can result from a linear constraint on conditional means, but also arises in cases where the data are first or second differences between observations at neighboring sites. For example, GMRF methods can be used to estimate parameters for random walks, based upon their paths. After fitting a random walk on the line, the authors go on to random walks on lattices, to random walks in continuous time observed at discrete random times, and to second order random walks. Very nice graphics are used to describe sums with a simple geometrical structure that would be hard to express with formal notation. The fourth chapter discusses hierarchical models, in which GMRF’s are used to model dependencies between parameters. As an example, one could observe a sequence Yi of Bernoulli(pi) random variables that are not independent. To model the dependence, one could assume that Xi = logit(Yi) arises from an autoregressive model and further assume that the variance of the random terms in that autoregressive process is random with some suitable distribution. Fitting a model of this kind requires use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are briefly discussed. The focus of these discussions is not on convergence (which is referenced elsewhere), but to the blocking of parameters to increase the efficiency of the MCMC algorithms. Other examples include the fitting of a model in which monthly numbers of driver deaths on British roads are modeled as",2006,3,819,111,False,Mathematics,40618053,L.

Here we significantly improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions: 1) The first polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. 2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the general US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time.

This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical RL, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free RL. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest. The code is at this http URL.",2017,58,359,71,False,Computer Science,145356667,Jakob N.

Most previous studies employ kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems, the importance of features in one source to an individual cluster of data can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.",2013,30,271,23,False,Computer Science,2113253801,Hua Wang,144962210.0,F.

In the first paper, we presented the machine-learning framework ML_EMO_HEV, which was developed for learning the knowledge about energy optimization in an HEV. The framework consists of machine-learning algorithms for predicting driving environments and generating the optimal power split of the HEV system for a given driving environment. In this paper, we present the following three online intelligent energy controllers: 1) IEC_HEV_SISE; 2) IEC_HEV_MISE ; and 3) IEC_HEV_MIME. All three online intelligent energy controllers were trained within the machine-learning framework ML_EMO_HEV to generate the best combination of engine power and battery power in real time such that the total fuel consumption over the whole driving cycle is minimized while still meeting the driver's demand and the system constraints, including engine, motor, battery, and generator operation limits. The three online controllers were integrated into the Ford Escape hybrid vehicle model for online performance evaluation. Based on their performances on ten test drive cycles provided by the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit library, we can conclude that the roadway type and traffic congestion level specific machine learning of optimal energy management is effective for in-vehicle energy control. The best controller, IEC_HEV_MISE, trained with the optimal power split generated by the DP optimization algorithm with multiple initial SOC points and single ending point, can provide fuel savings ranging from 5% to 19%. Together, these two papers cover the innovative technologies for modeling power flow, mathematical background of optimization in energy management, and machine-learning algorithms for generating intelligent energy controllers for quasioptimal energy flow in a power-split HEV.",2013,24,155,2,False,Engineering,9491649,Y.

Instead, edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical results.",2018,54,451,45,False,Computer Science,1637401447,Kai Yang,143872550.0,Tao Jiang,1754997.0,Yuanming Shi,145283850.0,Z.
