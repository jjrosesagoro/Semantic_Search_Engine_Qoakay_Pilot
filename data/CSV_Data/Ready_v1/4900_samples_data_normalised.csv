Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length (either due to brief recordings or previous trajectory segmentation) and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate single trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with high accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to determine the anomalous exponent with a small error, thus inherently providing a classification of the motion as normal or anomalous (sub- or super-diffusion). The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/test dataset. This allows for a full, high-accuracy characterization of experimental trajectories without the need of any prior information.",2020,41,63,0,False,Physics,1412620650,G. Muñoz-Gil,1398728149.0,M.

In this work, we present a general framework based on machine learning for reducing the impact of quantum hardware noise on quantum circuits. Our method, called noise-aware circuit learning (NACL), applies to circuits designed to compute a unitary transformation, prepare a set of quantum states, or estimate an observable of a many-qubit state. Given a task and a device model that captures information about the noise and connectivity of qubits in a device, NACL outputs an optimized circuit to accomplish this task in the presence of noise. It does so by minimizing a task-specific cost function over circuit depths and circuit structures. To demonstrate NACL, we construct circuits resilient to a fine-grained noise model derived from gate set tomography on a superconducting-circuit quantum device, for applications including quantum state overlap, quantum Fourier transform, and W-state preparation.",2020,55,57,1,True,Computer Science,49556529,L.

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms.

The rates of unplanned readmission are, therefore, regarded as an important performance indicator for the medical quality of a hospital and healthcare system. Identifying high-risk patients likely to suffer from readmission before release benefits both the patients and the medical providers. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to develop efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians. Methods and Findings We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate) that are significant in time series with temporal dependencies, which cannot be properly captured by traditional static models, but can be captured by our proposed deep neural network based model. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD9 embeddings. Our machine learning models identifies ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate (0.742) and an improved Area Under the Curve (0.791) compared with traditional methods. We also illustrate the importance of each portion of the features and different combinations of the models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision making accuracy, and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven results enable clinicians to make assisted decisions within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for hospitals by improving the detection of possible readmission. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",2018,82,83,9,True,Biology,2155853837,Yu-Wei Lin,2144119424.0,Yuqian Zhou,3404467.0,F.

This model has received substantial interest in machine learning due to its scalability and potential for parallel speedup. However, in high-dimensional settings, where the number examples is smaller than the number of features (""dimension""), the speedup afforded by distributed learning may be overshadowed by the cost of communicating a single example. This paper investigates the following question: When is it possible to learn a $d$-dimensional model in the distributed setting with total communication sublinear in $d$? 
Starting with a negative result, we show that for learning $\ell_1$-bounded or sparse linear models, no algorithm can obtain optimal error until communication is linear in dimension. Our main result is that that by slightly relaxing the standard boundedness assumptions for linear models, we can obtain distributed algorithms that enjoy optimal error with communication logarithmic in dimension.

However, advances in chip technology have given us miniature libraries that fit in our pockets and mobile processors have vastly increased in capability narrowing the vast gap between the simple processors embedded in such things and their more complex cousins in personal computers. Thus, with the current advancement in these devices, in terms of processing power, energy storage and memory capacity, the opportunity has arisen to extract great value in having on-device machine learning for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Implementing machine learning inference on edge devices has huge potential and is still in its early stages. However, it is already more powerful than most realise. In this paper, a step forward has been taken to understand the feasibility of running machine learning algorithms, both training and inference, on a Raspberry Pi, an embedded version of the Android operating system designed for IoT device development. Three different algorithms: Random Forests, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron, respectively, have been tested using ten diverse data sets on the Raspberry Pi to profile their performance in terms of speed (training and inference), accuracy, and power consumption. As a result of the conducted tests, the SVM algorithm proved to be slightly faster in inference and more efficient in power consumption, but the Random Forest algorithm exhibited the highest accuracy. In addition to the performance results, we will discuss their usability scenarios and the idea of implementing more complex and taxing algorithms such as Deep Learning on these small devices in more details.",2018,37,62,2,False,Computer Science,2071719758,Mahmut Taha Yazici,46226298.0,S.

Especially when classification is to be performed over many categories, providing enough training samples for each category is infeasible. This paper describes new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with little loss in accuracy. Thorough empirical evaluation of classification accuracy, noise sensitivity, imbalanced data, and computational performance on a diverse set of image datasets demonstrates the strengths of the proposed algorithms.",2012,55,121,11,True,Computer Science,1692604,Ajay J.

However, it is still challenging to develop effective diagnostic method with insufficient training data, which is highly demanded in real-industrial scenarios, since high-quality data are usually difficult and expensive to collect. Considering the underlying similarities of rotating machines, data mining on different but related equipments potentially benefit the diagnostic performance on the target machine. Therefore, a novel transfer learning method for diagnostics based on deep learning is proposed in this article, where the diagnostic knowledge learned from sufficient supervised data of multiple rotating machines is transferred to the target equipment with domain adversarial training. Different from the existing studies, a more generalized transfer learning problem with different label spaces of domains is investigated, and different fault severities are also considered in fault diagnostics. The experimental results on four datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show it is feasible and promising to explore different datasets to improve diagnostic performance.",2020,38,108,5,False,Computer Science,2144439563,Xiang Li,2155469192.0,Wei Zhang,145537225.0,Q.

In practice, we search for a function f with a finite representation f = Σi ci φi(·). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas.

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL/sup 3/)/sup l/ for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L/sup 2/) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L/sup 3/) for general state estimation and O(L/sup 2/) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L/sup 3/)). In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.",2001,13,1110,103,False,Mathematics,1908796,Rudolph van der Merwe,48385057.0,E.

Humans possess highly accurate internal recognition and learning mechanisms that are not yet understood, and they frequently have access to more extensive training data through a lifetime of unbiased experience with the visual world. We propose to use visual psychophysics to directly leverage the abilities of human subjects to build better machine learning systems. First, we use an advanced online psychometric testing platform to make new kinds of annotation data available for learning. Second, we develop a technique for harnessing these new kinds of information-“perceptual annotations”-for support vector machines. A key intuition for this approach is that while it may remain infeasible to dramatically increase the amount of data and high-quality labels available for the training of a given system, measuring the exemplar-by-exemplar difficulty and pattern of errors of human annotators can provide important information for regularizing the solution of the system at hand.

Datasets in extreme classification exhibit fit to power-law distribution, i.e. a large fraction of labels have very few positive instances in the data distribution. Most state-of-the-art approaches for extreme multi-label classification attempt to capture correlation among labels by embedding the label matrix to a low-dimensional linear sub-space. However, in the presence of power-law distributed extremely large and diverse label spaces, structural assumptions such as low rank can be easily violated. In this work, we present DiSMEC, which is a large-scale distributed framework for learning one-versus-rest linear classifiers coupled with explicit capacity control to control model size. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods, DiSMEC does not make any low rank assumptions on the label matrix. Using double layer of parallelization, DiSMEC can learn classifiers for datasets consisting hundreds of thousands labels within few hours. The explicit capacity control mechanism filters out spurious parameters which keep the model compact in size, without losing prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on publicly available real-world datasets consisting upto 670,000 labels. We compare DiSMEC with recent state-of-the-art approaches, including - SLEEC which is a leading approach for learning sparse local embeddings, and FastXML which is a tree-based approach optimizing ranking based loss function.

The analysis is based on a mapping procedure that maps the mutual learning in tree parity machines onto mutual learning in noisy perceptrons.

In the discrete case the learning process is based on a finite increment and a full synchronized state is achieved in a finite number of steps. The synchronization of discrete parity machines is introduced in order to construct an ephemeral key-exchange protocol.

In order to work efficiently, the location of mobile users needs to be predicted and properly exploited by mobile applications. We propose a spatial context model, which deals with the location prediction of mobile users. Such model is used for the classification of the users' trajectories through Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Predicting spatial context is treated through supervised learning.

For the past four decades, human decision-making under uncertainty has continued to be explained by theoretical models based on prospect theory, a framework that was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. However, theoretical models of this kind have developed slowly, and robust, high-precision predictive models of human decisions remain a challenge. While machine learning is a natural candidate for solving these problems, it is currently unclear to what extent it can improve predictions obtained by current theories. We argue that this is mainly due to data scarcity, since noisy human behavior requires massive sample sizes to be accurately captured by off-the-shelf machine learning methods. To solve this problem, what is needed are machine learning models with appropriate inductive biases for capturing human behavior, and larger datasets. We offer two contributions towards this end: first, we construct ""cognitive model priors"" by pretraining neural networks with synthetic data generated by cognitive models (i.e., theoretical models developed by cognitive psychologists). We find that fine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results in unprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second, we present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing over 240,000 human judgments across over 13,000 decision problems. This dataset reveals the circumstances where cognitive model priors are useful, and provides a new standard for benchmarking prediction of human decisions under uncertainty.",2019,27,45,3,False,Computer Science,145423354,David D.

Speaking to someone over the telephone usually begins by identifying who is speaking and, at least in cases of familiar speakers, a subjective verification by the listener that the identity is correct and the conversation can proceed. Automatic speaker-recognition systems have emerged as an important means of verifying identity in many e-commerce applications as well as in general business interactions, forensics, and law enforcement. Human experts trained in forensic speaker recognition can perform this task even better by examining a set of acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic characteristics of speech in a general approach referred to as structured listening. Techniques in forensic speaker recognition have been developed for many years by forensic speech scientists and linguists to help reduce any potential bias or preconceived understanding as to the validity of an unknown audio sample and a reference template from a potential suspect. Experienced researchers in signal processing and machine learning continue to develop automatic algorithms to effectively perform speaker recognition?with ever-improving performance?to the point where automatic systems start to perform on par with human listeners. In this article, we review the literature on speaker recognition by machines and humans, with an emphasis on prominent speaker-modeling techniques that have emerged in the last decade for automatic systems. We discuss different aspects of automatic systems, including voice-activity detection (VAD), features, speaker models, standard evaluation data sets, and performance metrics. Human speaker recognition is discussed in two parts?the first part involves forensic speaker-recognition methods, and the second illustrates how a na?ve listener performs this task from a neuroscience perspective.

How can we get a machine to learn language? It first presents an explicit computational model of language acquisition which can actually learn rules of English syntax given a sequence of grammatical, but otherwise unprepared, sentences.It shows that natural languages are designed to be easily learned and easily processed-an exciting breakthrough from the point of view of artificial intelligence and the design of expert systems because it shows how extensive knowledge might be acquired automatically, without outside intervention. Computationally, the book demonstrates how constraints that may be reasonably assumed to aid sentence processing also aid language acquisition.Chapters in the book's second part apply computational methods to the general problem of developmental growth, particularly the thorny problem of the interaction between innate genetic endowment and environmental input, with the intent of uncovering the constraints on the acquisition of syntactic knowledge. A number of ""mini-theories"" of learning are incorporated in this study of syntax with results that should appeal to a wide range of scholarly interests. These include how lexical categories, phonological rule systems, and phrase structure rules are learned; the role of semantic-syntactic interaction in language acquisition; how a ""parameter setting"" model may be formalized as a learning procedure; how multiple constraints (from syntax, thematic knowledge, or phrase structure) interact to aid acquisition; how transformational-type rules may be learned; and, the role of lexical ambiguity in language acquisition.Robert Berwick is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.

We approach the problem from the opposite direction and analyse a distance-based classifier that is realised by a simple quantum interference circuit.

In the KBCNN learning model, useful domain attributes and concepts are first identified and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge, and then the links are weighted properly so as to maintain the semantics. Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form. The domain of molecular genetics is used to demonstrate the validity of the KBCNN learning model and its superiority over related learning methods. >",1993,25,175,6,False,Computer Science,39779537,Limin Fu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large-scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set collection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1% of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90% in the 84.3% of the data sets. However, the difference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3% of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package).

However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.",2018,241,166,8,False,Computer Science,3191461,Wouter M.

This is largely due to the poor exploitation of application parallelism, subsequently resulting in performance levels far below those which a skilled expert programmer could achieve. We have identified two weaknesses in traditional parallelizing compilers and propose a novel, integrated approach, resulting in significant performance improvements of the generated parallel code. Using profile-driven parallelism detection we overcome the limitations of static analysis, enabling us to identify more application parallelism and only rely on the user for final approval. In addition, we replace the traditional target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics with a machine-learning based prediction mechanism, resulting in better mapping decisions while providing more scope for adaptation to different target architectures. We have evaluated our parallelization strategy against the NAS and SPEC OMP benchmarks and two different multi-core platforms (dual quad-core Intel Xeon SMP and dual-socket QS20 Cell blade). We demonstrate that our approach not only yields significant improvements when compared with state-of-the-art parallelizing compilers, but comes close to and sometimes exceeds the performance of manually parallelized codes. On average, our methodology achieves 96% of the performance of the hand-tuned OpenMP NAS and SPEC parallel benchmarks on the Intel Xeon platform and gains a significant speedup for the IBM Cell platform, demonstrating the potential of profile-guided and machine-learning based parallelization for complex multi-core platforms.",2009,42,245,9,False,Computer Science,2753715,Georgios Tournavitis,40072305.0,Zheng Wang,2644436.0,Björn Franke,1401533251.0,M.

While precise tap detection is nontrivial, requiring machine learning algorithms to identify fingerprints of closely spaced keys, sensitive sensors on modern devices aid the process. We present TapPrints, a framework for inferring the location of taps on mobile device touch-screens using motion sensor data combined with machine learning analysis. By running tests on two different off-the-shelf smartphones and a tablet computer we show that identifying tap locations on the screen and inferring English letters could be done with up to 90% and 80% accuracy, respectively.

The two measures for uncertainty and diversity were combined using the MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) method to give the sampling scores in our active learning strategy. We incorporated MMR-based active machine-learning idea into the biomedical named-entity recognition system. Our experimental results indicated that our strategies for active-learning based sample selection could significantly reduce the human effort.,2006,12,64,4,True,Computer Science,2047181,Seokhwan Kim,2152603843.0,Yu Song,2572316.0,Kyungduk Kim,2007875.0,Jeongwon Cha,2167149040.0,G.

Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly aligned examples. However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of complex, real-world images has required the careful selection of feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape. In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Specifically, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the specific data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned filters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW). Using the aligned images produced by our proposed unsupervised algorithm, we achieve higher accuracy in face verification compared to prior work in both unsupervised and supervised alignment. We also match the accuracy for the best available commercial method.",2012,47,298,39,False,Computer Science,3219900,Gary B. Huang,2985062.0,Marwan A. Mattar,1697141.0,Honglak Lee,1389846455.0,E.

With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists' use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists' mental models of interpretability tools. We conclude with implications for researchers and tool designers, and contextualize our findings in the social science literature.",2020,116,235,20,False,Computer Science,48712213,Harmanpreet Kaur,40900039.0,Harsha Nori,2057108610.0,Samuel Jenkins,145727186.0,R.

Experimental Design: Overall, 334 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and 101 patients with benign ovarian tumors were randomly assigned to “training” and “test” cohorts. Seven supervised machine learning classifiers, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), Conditional RF (CRF), Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, and Elastic Net, were used to derive diagnostic and prognostic information from 32 parameters commonly available from pretreatment peripheral blood tests and age. Results: Machine learning techniques were superior to conventional regression-based analyses in predicting multiple clinical parameters pertaining to EOC. Ensemble methods combining weak decision trees, such as GBM, RF, and CRF, showed the best performance in EOC prediction. The values for the highest accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for segregating EOC from benign ovarian tumors with RF were 92.4% and 0.968, respectively. The highest accuracy and AUC for predicting clinical stages with RF were 69.0% and 0.760, respectively. High-grade serous and mucinous histotypes of EOC could be preoperatively predicted with RF. An ordinal RF classifier could distinguish complete resection from others. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified subgroups among early-stage EOC patients with significantly worse survival. Conclusions: Machine learning systems can provide critical diagnostic and prognostic prediction for patients with EOC before initial intervention, and the use of predictive algorithms may facilitate personalized treatment options through pretreatment stratification of patients.",2019,33,69,4,False,Medicine,35710644,Eiryo Kawakami,79285108.0,Junya Tabata,50006097.0,N.

There are still unexplained differences among the performance measurements of different algorithms, hence it is warranted to deepen the investigation into which algorithm has the right ‘bias’ for this task. In this paper, we show that this is not easy to accomplish, due to intricate interactions between information sources, parameter settings, and properties of the training data. We investigate the impact of parameter optimization on generalization accuracy in a memory-based learning approach to English and Dutch WSD. A ‘word-expert’ architecture was adopted, yielding a set of classifiers, each specialized in one single wordform. The experts consist of multiple memory-based learning classifiers, each taking different information sources as input, combined in a voting scheme. We optimized the architectural and parametric settings for each individual word-expert by performing cross-validation experiments on the learning material. The results of these experiments show that the variation of both the algorithmic parameters and the information sources available to the classifiers leads to large fluctuations in accuracy. We demonstrate that optimization per word-expert leads to an overall significant improvement in the generalization accuracies of the produced WSD systems.",2002,23,88,5,True,Computer Science,2653729,Veronique Hoste,1708288.0,Iris Hendrickx,1735272.0,Walter Daelemans,145977875.0,Antal van den Bosch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning in bioinformatics can be powerful but carries also the risk of introducing unexpected biases, which may lead to an overestimation of the performance. This article espouses a set of guidelines to allow both peer reviewers and authors to avoid common machine learning pitfalls. Understanding biology is necessary to produce useful data sets, which have to be large and diverse. Separating the training and test process is imperative to avoid over-selling method performance, which is also dependent on several hidden parameters. A novel predictor has always to be compared with several existing methods, including simple baseline strategies. Using the presented guidelines will help nonspecialists to appreciate the critical issues in machine learning.",2016,47,49,1,True,Medicine,144218611,Ian Walsh,2028880.0,G. Pollastri,1801645.0,S.

Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitative insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.",1998,12,194,14,False,Computer Science,1763295,J.
