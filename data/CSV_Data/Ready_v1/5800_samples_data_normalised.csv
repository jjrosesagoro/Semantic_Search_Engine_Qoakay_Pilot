This disease can be detected by distinguishing malignant and benign tumors. Hence, doctors require trustworthy diagnosing process in order to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. Therefore, the automation of this process is required to recognize tumors. Numerous research works have tried to apply the algorithms of machine learning for classifying breast cancer and it was proven by many researchers that machine learning algorithms act preferable in the diagnosing process. In this paper, three machine-learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision tree) have been used and the performance of these classifiers has been compared in order to detect which classifier works better in the classification of breast cancer. Furthermore, the dataset of Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) has been used in this study. The main aim of this work is to make comparison among several classifiers and find the best classifier which gives better accuracy. The outcomes of this study have revealed that quadratic support vector machine grants the largest accuracy of (98.1%) with lowest false discovery rates.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing run.",2016,64,201,9,True,Physics,13322962,M. Zevin,39507823.0,S. Coughlin,3185424.0,S. Bahaadini,1962615.0,E.

We develop a machine learning model to calculate density functional theory quality formation energies of all ∼2×10^{6} pristine ABC_{2}D_{6} elpasolite crystals that can be made up from main-group elements (up to bismuth). Our model's accuracy can be improved systematically, reaching a mean absolute error of 0.1  eV/atom for a training set consisting of 10×10^{3} crystals. Important bonding trends are revealed: fluoride is best suited to fit the coordination of the D site, which lowers the formation energy whereas the opposite is found for carbon. The bonding contribution of the elements A and B is very small on average. Low formation energies result from A and B being late elements from group II, C being a late (group I) element, and D being fluoride. Out of 2×10^{6} crystals, 90 unique structures are predicted to be on the convex hull-among which is NFAl_{2}Ca_{6}, with a peculiar stoichiometry and a negative atomic oxidation state for Al.",2015,45,231,0,True,Physics,145483118,Felix A Faber,13174355.0,Alexander Hans Gustav Lindmaa,7847508.0,O.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL.",2019,222,713,48,True,Computer Science,1753717562,Wei Yang Bryan Lim,3046954.0,Nguyen Cong Luong,2233724.0,D.

We built three classification models with training data of 76,936 posts from two large online forums and applied the models to classify messages into statistics-related and non-statistics-related posts in a private Facebook group. Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades. Students who failed the course also had significantly fewer messages endorsed by all three ML algorithms than those who passed.

Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\it instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100. Although assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to outperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an instance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that of CD-100 for the case studied here.",2015,27,153,10,True,Physics,3468759,M.

Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.",2016,59,327,13,False,Mathematics,14594344,S.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the preferred optimization algorithm for training these networks and asynchronous SGD (ASGD) has been widely adopted for accelerating the training of large-scale deep networks in a distributed computing environment. However, in practice it is quite challenging to tune the training hyperparameters (such as learning rate) when using ASGD so as achieve convergence and linear speedup, since the stability of the optimization algorithm is strongly influenced by the asynchronous nature of parameter updates.

High performance and extreme energy efficiency are critical for deployments of CNNs, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array. On contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7× and 2.3×, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.",2017,32,794,119,False,Computer Science,1790421,A.

In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

However, audio sensing is highly susceptible to wild fluctuations in accuracy when used in diverse acoustic environments (such as, bedrooms, vehicles, or cafes), that users encounter on a daily basis. Towards addressing this challenge, we turn to the field of deep learning; an area of machine learning that has radically changed related audio modeling domains like speech recognition. In this paper, we present DeepEar -- the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices.

We present a new extension of the bump hunt that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms while remaining model agnostic. This approach is based on the classification without labels (CWoLa) method where the invariant mass is used to create two potentially mixed samples, one with little or no signal and one with a potential resonance. Additional features that are uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier. Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such model-agnostic approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel that would not be covered with existing techniques.",2019,82,91,4,True,Physics,153639309,J.

While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing---synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone. We applied our methodology using the Open Directory Project, the largest existing Web directory built by over 70,000 human editors.

We study the software defect prediction problem, which focuses on predicting which modules will experience a failure during operation. Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goal is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification.

Small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes. However, detection of ncRNA genes is a great challenge to both experimental and computational approaches. In this study, we describe a new approach called positive sample only learning (PSoL) to predict ncRNA genes in the Escherichia coli genome. Although PSoL is a machine learning method for classification, it requires no negative training data, which, in general, is hard to define properly and affects the performance of machine learning dramatically. In addition, using the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learning algorithm, PSoL can integrate many different kinds of information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Besides the application of PSoL for predicting ncRNAs, PSoL is applicable to many other bioinformatics problems as well.


RESULTS
The PSoL method is assessed by 5-fold cross-validation experiments which show that PSoL can achieve about 80% accuracy in recovery of known ncRNAs. We compared PSoL predictions with five previously published results. The PSoL method has the highest percentage of predictions overlapping with those from other methods.",2006,53,99,10,False,Medicine,2108870380,Chunlin Wang,1737469.0,C. Ding,2129789.0,R.

This paper proposes a novel EMG classifier called cascaded kernel learning machine (CKLM) to achieve the goal of high-accuracy EMG recognition. First, the EMG signals are acquired by three surface electrodes placed on three different muscles. Second, EMG features are extracted by autoregressive model (ARM) and EMG histogram. After the feature extraction, the CKLM is performed to classify the features. CKLM is composed of two different kinds of kernel learning machines: generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). By using GDA, both the goals of the dimensionality reduction of input features and the selection of discriminating features, named kernel FisherEMG, can be reached. Then, SVM combined with one-against-one strategy is executed to classify the kernel FisherEMG. By cascading SVM with GDA, the input features will be nonlinearly mapped twice by radial-basis function (RBF). As a result, a linear optimal separating hyperplane can be found with the largest margin of separation between each pair of postures' classes in the implicit dot product feature space. In addition, we develop a digital signal processor (DSP)-based EMG classification system for the control of a multi-degrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand for the practical implementation. Based on the clinical experiments, the results show that the proposed CKLM is superior to other frequently used methods, such as k-nearest neighbor algorithm, multilayer neural network, and SVM. The best EMG recognition rate 93.54% is obtained by CKLM.",2007,33,104,8,False,Computer Science,47909860,Yi-Hung Liu,1734312.0,Han-Pang Huang,50985940.0,C.H.

However, there is an inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolution, and thus, these cameras often sparsely sample in either spatial or angular domain. In this paper, we use machine learning to mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we propose a novel learning-based approach to synthesize new views from a sparse set of input views. We build upon existing view synthesis techniques and break down the process into disparity and color estimation components. We use two sequential convolutional neural networks to model these two components and train both networks simultaneously by minimizing the error between the synthesized and ground truth images. We show the performance of our approach using only four corner sub-aperture views from the light fields captured by the Lytro Illum camera. Experimental results show that our approach synthesizes high-quality images that are superior to the state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of challenging real-world scenes.

However, CTA generally overestimates stenosis severity compared with invasive angiography, and angiographic stenosis does not necessarily imply hemodynamic relevance when fractional flow reserve (FFR) is used as reference. CTA-based FFR (CT-FFR), using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), improves the correlation with invasive FFR results but is computationally demanding. More recently, a new machine-learning (ML) CT-FFR algorithm has been developed based on a deep learning model, which can be performed on a regular workstation. In this large multicenter cohort, the diagnostic performance ML-based CT-FFR was compared with CTA and CFD-based CT-FFR for detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: At 5 centers in Europe, Asia, and the United States, 351 patients, including 525 vessels with invasive FFR comparison, were included. ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR were performed on the CTA data, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using invasive FFR as reference. Correlation between ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR was excellent (R=0.997). ML-based (area under curve, 0.84) and CFD-based CT-FFR (0.84) outperformed visual CTA (0.69; P<0.0001). On a per-vessel basis, diagnostic accuracy improved from 58% (95% confidence interval, 54%–63%) by CTA to 78% (75%–82%) by ML-based CT-FFR. The per-patient accuracy improved from 71% (66%–76%) by CTA to 85% (81%–89%) by adding ML-based CT-FFR as 62 of 85 (73%) false-positive CTA results could be correctly reclassified by adding ML-based CT-FFR.

For more than a decade we have developed state‐of‐art predictors by carefully selecting and optimising inputs to a machine learning method. The correlation has increased from 0.60 in ProQ to 0.81 in ProQ2 and 0.85 in ProQ3 mainly by adding a large set of carefully tuned descriptions of a protein. Here, we show that a substantial improvement can be obtained using exactly the same inputs as in ProQ2 or ProQ3 but replacing the support vector machine by a deep neural network. This improves the Pearson correlation to 0.90 (0.85 using ProQ2 input features).

A detailed comparison of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms in terms of the computational time and the CA is performed. The classified occupancy status is further utilized to evaluate the blocking probability of secondary user for future time slots, which can be used by system designers to define spectrum-allocation and spectrum-sharing policies.

This paper introduces a new machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) toolbox into the scientific Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator (ARTMO) software package. ARTMO facilitates retrieval of biophysical parameters from remote observations in a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) environment. The MLRA toolbox enables analyzing the predictive power of various MLRAs in a semiautomatic and systematic manner, and applying a selected MLRA to multispectral or hyperspectral imagery for mapping applications. It contains both linear and nonlinear state-of-the-art regression algorithms, in particular linear feature extraction via principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision trees (DTs), neural networks (NNs), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The performance of multiple implemented regression strategies has been evaluated against the SPARC dataset (Barrax, Spain) and simulated Sentinel-2 (8 bands), CHRIS (62 bands) and HyMap (125 bands) observations. In general, nonlinear regression algorithms (NN, KRR, and GPR) outperformed linear techniques (PCR and PLSR) in terms of accuracy, bias, and robustness. Most robust results along gradients of training/validation partitioning and noise variance were obtained by KRR while GPR delivered most accurate estimations. We applied a GPR model to a hyperspectral HyMap flightline to map LCC and LAI.

We first argue that standard Contrastive Divergence-based learning may not be suitable for training CRBMs. We then identify two distinct types of structured output prediction problems and propose an improved learning algorithm for each. The first problem type is one where the output space has arbitrary structure but the set of likely output configurations is relatively small, such as in multi-label classification. The second problem is one where the output space is arbitrarily structured but where the output space variability is much greater, such as in image denoising or pixel labeling.

The weights of edges in the graph are obtained by seeking a nonnegative low-rank and sparse matrix that represents each data sample as a linear combination of others. The so-obtained NNLRS-graph can capture both the global mixture of subspaces structure (by the low rankness) and the locally linear structure (by the sparseness) of the data, hence is both generative and discriminative.

Dropout variational inference (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical applications, but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty. Alpha-divergences are alternative divergences to VI's KL objective, which are able to avoid VI's uncertainty underestimation. But these are hard to use in practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of limited use for practitioners. We propose a reparametrisation of the alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which, together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply changing the loss of the model.

The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to damage at the very earliest stages of AD. This article seeks to evaluate critical AD-associated regional changes in the hippocampus using machine learning methods.

Regional changes of bilateral hippocampi were characterized using computational anatomic mapping methods. A feature selection method for support vector machine and leave-1-out cross-validation was introduced to determine regional shape differences that minimized the error rate in the datasets. RESULTS: Patients with AD showed significant deformations in the CA1 region of bilateral hippocampi, as well as the subiculum of the left hippocampus. There were also some changes in the CA2–4 subregions of the left hippocampus among patients with AD. Moreover, the left hippocampal surface showed greater variations than the right compared with those in healthy control subjects. The accuracies of leave-1-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation experiments for assessing the reliability of these subregions were more than 80% in bilateral hippocampi.

Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. 
In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. 
Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.

He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and isDirector of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.",1992,40,12019,482,False,Computer Science,144404817,J.

It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BOOSTMETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. BOOSTMETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process.

It was asserted in the literature that minutiae points, which are commonly used for fingerprint matching, are not useful for classification. We show that, to the contrary, near state-of-the-art classification accuracy rates can be achieved when applying topological data analysis (TDA) to 3-dimensional point clouds of oriented minutiae points. We also apply TDA to fingerprint ink-roll images, which yields a lower accuracy rate but still shows promise; moreover, combining the two approaches outperforms each one individually. These methods use supervised learning applied to persistent homology and allow us to explore feature selection on barcodes, an important topic at the interface between TDA and machine learning.

We propose a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70,000 words mapped to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning from raw text. The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data.

This separation makes incorporating machine learning capabilities inside applications unnecessarily costly and difficult, and furthermore discourage developers from embracing ML in first place.

Seizure prediction is a major field of neurological research, enabled by statistical analysis methods applied to features derived from intracranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity. However, no reliable seizure prediction method is ready for clinical applications. In this study, we use modern machine learning techniques to predict seizures from a number of features proposed in the literature. We concentrate on aggregated features that encode the relationship between pairs of EEG channels, such as cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, difference of Lyapunov exponents and wavelet analysis-based synchrony such as phase locking. We compare L1-regularized logistic regression, convolutional networks, and support vector machines. Results are reported on the standard Freiburg EEG dataset which contains data from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy.

The two problems we consider are: (1) determination of whether procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA sequences segments are translated to protein. An accuracy of 99.4% is reported for procaryotic DNA (E. coli) and 98.4% for eucaryotic DNA (H. Sapiens genes known to be expressed in liver); (2) determination of whether eucaryotic DNA sequence segments containing the dinucleotides ''AG'' or ''GT'' are transcribed to RNA splice junctions. Accuracy of 91.2% was achieved on intron/exon splice junctions (acceptor sites) and 92.8% on exon/intron splice junctions (donor sites).

A variety of neural network, machine learning, and information theoretic algorithms are used.

This paper aims to predict childhood obesity after age two, using only data collected prior to the second birthday by a clinical decision support system called CHICA.


METHODS
Analyses of six different machine learning methods: RandomTree, RandomForest, J48, ID3, Naïve Bayes, and Bayes trained on CHICA data show that an accurate, sensitive model can be created.


RESULTS
Of the methods analyzed, the ID3 model trained on the CHICA dataset proved the best overall performance with accuracy of 85% and sensitivity of 89%. Additionally, the ID3 model had a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 88%. The structure of the tree also gives insight into the strongest predictors of future obesity in children. Many of the strongest predictors seen in the ID3 modeling of the CHICA dataset have been independently validated in the literature as correlated with obesity, thereby supporting the validity of the model.
