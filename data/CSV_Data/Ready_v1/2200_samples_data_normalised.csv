In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx 15$  years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.",2015,52,3682,286,True,Computer Science,Medicine,3035541,Klaus Greff,2100612.0,R.

This is typically carried out by the Friedman test. When the Friedman test rejects the null hypothesis, multiple comparisons are carried out to establish which are the significant differences among algorithms. The multiple comparisons are usually performed using the mean-ranks test. The aim of this technical note is to discuss the inconsistencies of the mean-ranks post-hoc test with the goal of discouraging its use in machine learning as well as in medicine, psychology, etc. We show that the outcome of the mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in the experiment. In other words, the outcome of the comparison between algorithms A and B depends also on the performance of the other algorithms included in the original experiment. This can lead to paradoxical situations. For instance the difference between A and B could be declared significant if the pool comprises algorithms C, D, E and not significant if the pool comprises algorithms F, G, H. To overcome these issues, we suggest instead to perform the multiple comparison using a test whose outcome only depends on the two algorithms being compared, such as the sign-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.",2015,23,219,12,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,1792368,A.

Generalized Transferability for Evasion and Poisoning Attacks,"Attacks against machine learning systems represent a growing threat as highlighted by the abundance of attacks proposed lately. However, attacks often make unrealistic assumptions about the knowledge and capabilities of adversaries. To evaluate this threat systematically, we propose the FAIL attacker model, which describes the adversary's knowledge and control along four dimensions. The FAIL model allows us to consider a wide range of weaker adversaries that have limited control and incomplete knowledge of the features, learning algorithms and training instances utilized. Within this framework, we evaluate the generalized transferability of a known evasion attack and we design StingRay, a targeted poisoning attack that is broadly applicable---it is practical against 4 machine learning applications, which use 3 different learning algorithms, and it can bypass 2 existing defenses. Our evaluation provides deeper insights into the transferability of poison and evasion samples across models and suggests promising directions for investigating defenses against this threat.",2018,61,174,17,False,Computer Science,,31765629,Octavian Suciu,4951026.0,R.

They operate on a DAG of computational operators, wrapping high-performance libraries such as CUDNN (for NVIDIA GPUs) or NNPACK (for various CPUs), and automate memory allocation, synchronization, distribution. Custom operators are needed where the computation does not fit existing high-performance library calls, usually at a high engineering cost. This is frequently required when new operators are invented by researchers: such operators suffer a severe performance penalty, which limits the pace of innovation. Furthermore, even if there is an existing runtime call these frameworks can use, it often doesn't offer optimal performance for a user's particular network architecture and dataset, missing optimizations between operators as well as optimizations that can be done knowing the size and shape of data. Our contributions include (1) a language close to the mathematics of deep learning called Tensor Comprehensions offering both imperative and declarative styles, (2) a polyhedral Just-In-Time compiler to convert a mathematical description of a deep learning DAG into a CUDA kernel with delegated memory management and synchronization, also providing optimizations such as operator fusion and specialization for specific sizes, (3) a compilation cache populated by an autotuner.

Accurate performance modeling of an application would help users in better VM sizing, thus reducing costs. It can also benefit cloud service providers who can offer a new charging model based on the VMs' performance instead of their configured sizes. In this paper, we present techniques to model the performance of a VM-hosted application as a function of the resources allocated to the VM and the resource contention it experiences. To address this multi-dimensional modeling problem, we propose and refine the use of two machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). We evaluate these modeling techniques using five virtualized applications from the RUBiS and Filebench suite of benchmarks and demonstrate that their median and 90th percentile prediction errors are within 4.36% and 29.17% respectively. These results are substantially better than regression based approaches as well as direct applications of machine learning techniques without our refinements. We also present a simple and effective approach to VM sizing and empirically demonstrate that it can deliver optimal results for 65% of the sizing problems that we studied and produces close-to-optimal sizes for the remaining 35%.",2012,40,128,14,False,Computer Science,Engineering,3070722,Sajib Kundu,1709495.0,R.

Performance of ELM is compared in terms of training time and classification accuracy with a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) classifier and also Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For SVMs, the comparisons have been made for both 1-against-1 and 1-against-all methods. Results show that ELM needs an order of magnitude less training time compared with SVMs and two orders of magnitude less compared with BPNN.

Second, we view hierarchical relations as partial orders defined using a family of nested geodesically convex cones.

This is prohibitively expensive, and corners are cut to reach conclusions. We model the whole benchmarking process, revealing that variance due to data sampling, parameter initialization and hyperparameter choice impact markedly the results. We analyze the predominant comparison methods used today in the light of this variance. We show a counter-intuitive result that adding more sources of variation to an imperfect estimator approaches better the ideal estimator at a 51 × reduction in compute cost.

Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a method which learns to optimize device placement for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the sequence-to-sequence model. Our main result is that on Inception-V3 for ImageNet classification, and on RNN LSTM, for language modeling and neural machine translation, our model finds non-trivial device placements that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algorithmic methods.",2017,49,339,36,False,Computer Science,,1861312,Azalia Mirhoseini,143950636.0,Hieu Pham,2827616.0,Quoc V.

A series of recent works study the linear speedup property of distributed SGD variants with reduced communication. The linear speedup property enable us to scale out the computing capability by adding more computing nodes into our system. The reduced communication complexity is desirable since communication overhead is often the performance bottleneck in distributed systems. Recently, momentum methods are more and more widely adopted in training machine learning models and can often converge faster and generalize better. For example, many practitioners use distributed SGD with momentum to train deep neural networks with big data. However, it remains unclear whether any distributed momentum SGD possesses the same linear speedup property as distributed SGD and has reduced communication complexity.

Compared to alternative approaches, this Heusler discovery engine performs exceptionally well, making fast and reliable predictions of the occurrence of Heusler vs non-Heusler compounds for an arbitrary combination of elements with no structural input on over 400 000 candidates.

Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNets introduce a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer.

The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a generalization of the original ""feature map"" common to support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery, and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions.",2016,309,451,48,True,Computer Science,Mathematics,2276351,Krikamol Muandet,1693668.0,K. Fukumizu,3313411.0,Bharath K.

Recognizing proteins that have similar tertiary structure is the key step of template-based protein structure prediction methods. Traditionally, a variety of alignment methods are used to identify similar folds, based on sequence similarity and sequence-structure compatibility. Although these methods are complementary, their integration has not been thoroughly exploited. Statistical machine learning methods provide tools for integrating multiple features, but so far these methods have been used primarily for protein and fold classification, rather than addressing the retrieval problem of fold recognition-finding a proper template for a given query protein.


RESULTS
Here we present a two-stage machine learning, information retrieval, approach to fold recognition. First, we use alignment methods to derive pairwise similarity features for query-template protein pairs. We also use global profile-profile alignments in combination with predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact map and beta-strand pairing to extract pairwise structural compatibility features. Second, we apply support vector machines to these features to predict the structural relevance (i.e. in the same fold or not) of the query-template pairs. For each query, the continuous relevance scores are used to rank the templates. The FOLDpro approach is modular, scalable and effective. Compared with 11 other fold recognition methods, FOLDpro yields the best results in almost all standard categories on a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Using predictions of the top-ranked template, the sensitivity is approximately 85, 56, and 27% at the family, superfamily and fold levels respectively. Using the 5 top-ranked templates, the sensitivity increases to 90, 70, and 48%.",2006,123,225,12,True,Computer Science,Medicine,39609402,Jianlin Cheng,144902513.0,P.

The learning process, however, consists also of latent attributes, such as the learner's cognitions or emotions. These attributes are unobservable to sensors and need to be elicited by human‐driven interpretations.

In practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We introduce \emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers. Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers. Interestingly, we also empirically observe that the dampening component is interesting in its own right for it enables to build an SGD algorithm that outperforms alternative staleness-aware asynchronous competitors in environments with honest workers.",2018,36,81,10,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,11008382,Georgios Damaskinos,9623412.0,El Mahdi El Mhamdi,1727558.0,R.

Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs.

DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results.


RESULTS
We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97,802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.

Machine Learning and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) are recent methods developed to create and evaluate prediction models. Methods and finding We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a prospective collected database from December 2005 to December 2012, from a cardiac surgical center at University Hospital. The different models of prediction of mortality in-hospital after elective cardiac surgery, including EuroSCORE II, a logistic regression model and a machine learning model, were compared by ROC and DCA. Of the 6,520 patients having elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, 6.3% died. Mean age was 63.4 years old (standard deviation 14.4), and mean EuroSCORE II was 3.7 (4.8) %. The area under ROC curve (IC95%) for the machine learning model (0.795 (0.755–0.834)) was significantly higher than EuroSCORE II or the logistic regression model (respectively, 0.737 (0.691–0.783) and 0.742 (0.698–0.785), p < 0.0001). Decision Curve Analysis showed that the machine learning model, in this monocentric study, has a greater benefit whatever the probability threshold. Conclusions According to ROC and DCA, machine learning model is more accurate in predicting mortality after elective cardiac surgery than EuroSCORE II.

Constraints of this form are susceptible to intentional or inadvertent ""fairness gerrymandering"", in which a classifier appears to be fair on each individual group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on one or more structured subgroups defined over the protected attributes. We propose instead to demand statistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected attributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and recently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several computational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier to see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness. We prove that the computational problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false positive rates and statistical parity is equivalent to the problem of weak agnostic learning, which means it is computationally hard in the worst case, even for simple structured subclasses. 
We then derive two algorithms that provably converge to the best fair classifier, given access to oracles which can solve the agnostic learning problem. The algorithms are based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a two-player zero-sum game between a Learner and an Auditor. Our first algorithm provably converges in a polynomial number of steps. Our second algorithm enjoys only provably asymptotic convergence, but has the merit of simplicity and faster per-step computation. We implement the simpler algorithm using linear regression as a heuristic oracle, and show that we can effectively both audit and learn fair classifiers on real datasets.",2017,60,480,47,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,81338045,M.

A constant sfream of data bombards our senses and millions of sensory channels carry information into our brains. Brains are also learning machines that condition, combine, parse, and store data. Is it possible to learn something about learning by observing the style of computation used by brains? This is the motivation for research into computational devices that today are called ""neural networks."" Neural networks are nonlinear dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom that can be used to solve computational problems. The mathematical foundations for learning in this class of machines was laid by agroup of researchers in the 1940s and 1950s. The achievement documented in this book is the thorough study of one of the simplest members of this class, feedforward networks with one layer of m w ~ a b l e weights connecting input units to output units. In a sense, these might be called reflex machines. The knee-jerk reflex, for example, is mediated by synaptic connections from the sensory recepton in your knee directly onto rnotoneurons in your spinal cord that in turn activate leg muscles. There are limits to how much computation can be accomplished by such reflexes, and these limits have been carefully delineated in this book. Just as more complex creatures evolved by layering control loops on the primitive reflexes, network models have also evolved in recent years and now have achieved vastly greater capabilities than reflex machines by making use of multilayered architectures with feedback connections. Nonetheless, recent work could not have been accomplished without building on these foundations. vii viil INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION ix Despite the early promise of research on neural networks, there was a period of about 20 years, from the mid 1960s to the mid 1980s. when interest in neural networks as computational devices and models of human behavior waned in favor of models based on symbol processing. There are many reasons for this, some of them now evident in this book. Still, Learning Machines was an underground classic among the neural network modelers who were active during this ""dark age"" and deserves to be better known to the generation that is ""relearning"" what was once known about statistical learning machines. The intuitive geometric explanations and the mathematical foundations in this monograph are as invaluable today as they were when it was first written.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) by learning features directly from the image data instead of using analytically extracted features. However, CNNs are difficult to train from scratch for medical images due to small sample sizes and variations in tumor presentations. Instead, transfer learning can be used to extract tumor information from medical images via CNNs originally pretrained for nonmedical tasks, alleviating the need for large datasets. Our database includes 219 breast lesions (607 full-field digital mammographic images). We compared support vector machine classifiers based on the CNN-extracted image features and our prior computer-extracted tumor features in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. Five-fold cross validation (by lesion) was conducted with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the performance metric. Results show that classifiers based on CNN-extracted features (with transfer learning) perform comparably to those using analytically extracted features [area under the ROC curve (AUC)=0.81]. Further, the performance of ensemble classifiers based on both types was significantly better than that of either classifier type alone (AUC=0.86 versus 0.81, p=0.022). We conclude that transfer learning can improve current CADx methods while also providing standalone classifiers without large datasets, facilitating machine-learning methods in radiomics and precision medicine.",2016,18,373,12,True,Medicine,Engineering,7257452,B.

The goal of the competition was to create a complicated black box model for the dataset and explain how it worked. One team did not follow the rules. Instead of sending in a black box, they created a model that was fully interpretable. This leads to the question of whether the real world of machine learning is similar to the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, where black box models are used even when they are not needed. We discuss this team’s thought processes during the competition and their implications, which reach far beyond the competition itself.Keywords: interpretability, explainability, machine learning, finance",2019,13,128,5,True,Computer Science,,48395540,C.

Most previous work has only considered the refinement of the network's conditional probability parameters and has not addressed the issue of refining the network's structure. We tackle this problem by a machine learning approach based on a formalism known as the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle is well suited to this task since it can perform tradeoffs between the accuracy, simplicity, and closeness to the existent structure. Another salient feature of this refinement approach is the capability of refining a network structure using partially specified data. Moreover, a localization scheme is developed for efficient computation of the description lengths since direct evaluation involves exponential time resources.",1998,25,59,2,False,Computer Science,,144594306,Wai Lam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we propose to learn manifold coordinates for the relevant factors of variation and to model their joint interaction. Many existing feature learning algorithms focus on a single task and extract features that are sensitive to the task-relevant factors and invariant to all others. However, models that just extract a single set of invariant features do not exploit the relationships among the latent factors. To address this, we propose a higher-order Boltzmann machine that incorporates multiplicative interactions among groups of hidden units that each learn to encode a distinct factor of variation. Furthermore, we propose correspondence-based training strategies that allow effective disentangling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition and face verification performance on the Toronto Face Database.

Here, we present the theory and in vivo experimental paradigm to illustrate how this BMI learns to complete a reaching task using a prosthetic arm in a 3-D workspace based on the user's neuronal activity. This semisupervised learning framework does not require user movements.

The current practice for estimating the parameters of such models relies on local search heuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and existing consistent methods are unfavorable due to their high computational and sample complexity which typically scale exponentially with the number of mixture components. This work develops an efficient method of moments approach to parameter estimation for a broad class of high-dimensional mixture models with many components, including multi-view mixtures of Gaussians (such as mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models. The new method leads to rigorous unsupervised learning results for mixture models that were not achieved by previous works; and, because of its simplicity, it offers a viable alternative to EM for practical deployment.",2012,43,317,58,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,2047844,Anima Anandkumar,143724861.0,Daniel J.

While the demand for these compute-intensive applications is growing, the performance benefits from general-purpose platforms are diminishing. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a promising path forward to accommodate the needs of machine learning algorithms and represent an intermediate point between the efficiency of ASICs and the programmability of general-purpose processors. However, acceleration with FPGAs still requires long development cycles and extensive expertise in hardware design. To tackle this challenge, instead of designing an accelerator for a machine learning algorithm, we present TABLA, a framework that generates accelerators for a class of machine learning algorithms. The key is to identify the commonalities across a wide range of machine learning algorithms and utilize this commonality to provide a high-level abstraction for programmers. TABLA leverages the insight that many learning algorithms can be expressed as a stochastic optimization problem. Therefore, learning becomes solving an optimization problem using stochastic gradient descent that minimizes an objective function over the training data. The gradient descent solver is fixed while the objective function changes for different learning algorithms. TABLA provides a template-based framework to accelerate this class of learning algorithms. Therefore, a developer can specify the learning task by only expressing the gradient of the objective function using our high-level language. Tabla then automatically generates the synthesizable implementation of the accelerator for FPGA realization using a set of hand-optimized templates. We use Tabla to generate accelerators for ten different learning tasks targeted at a Xilinx Zynq FPGA platform. We rigorously compare the benefits of FPGA acceleration to multi-core CPUs (ARM Cortex A15 and Xeon E3) and many-core GPUs (Tegra K1, GTX 650 Ti, and Tesla K40) using real hardware measurements. TABLA-generated accelerators provide 19.4x and 2.9x average speedup over the ARM and Xeon processors, respectively. These accelerators provide 17.57x, 20.2x, and 33.4x higher Performance-per-Watt in comparison to Tegra, GTX 650 Ti and Tesla, respectively. These benefits are achieved while the programmers write less than 50 lines of code.",2016,63,142,7,True,Computer Science,,33278013,Divya Mahajan,3101741.0,Jongse Park,2053398.0,Emmanuel Amaro,32646274.0,Hardik Sharma,2112229.0,A.

In recent years, a number of image saliency methods have been developed to summarize where highly complex neural networks “look” in an image for evidence for their predictions. However, these techniques are limited by their heuristic nature and architectural constraints. In this paper, we make two main contributions: First, we propose a general framework for learning different kinds of explanations for any black box algorithm. Second, we specialise the framework to find the part of an image most responsible for a classifier decision.

However, much of the work on these algorithms has been developed with regard to discrete nite-state Markovian problems, which is too restrictive for many real-world environments. Therefore, it is desirable to extend these methods to high dimensional continuous state-spaces, which requires the use of function approximation to generalise the information learnt by the system. In this report, the use of back-propagation neural networks (Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986) is considered in this context. We consider a number of di erent algorithms based around Q-Learning (Watkins 1989) combined with the Temporal Di erence algorithm (Sutton 1988), including a new algorithm (Modi ed Connectionist Q-Learning), and Q( ) (Peng and Williams 1994). In addition, we present algorithms for applying these updates on-line during trials, unlike backward replay used by Lin (1993) that requires waiting until the end of each trial before updating can occur. On-line updating is found to be more robust to the choice of training parameters than backward replay, and also enables the algorithms to be used in continuously operating systems where no end of trial conditions occur. We compare the performance of these algorithms on a realistic robot navigation problem, where a simulated mobile robot is trained to guide itself to a goal position in the presence of obstacles. The robot must rely on limited sensory feedback from its surroundings, and make decisions that can be generalised to arbitrary layouts of obstacles. These simulations show that on-line learning algorithms are less sensitive to the choice of training parameters than backward replay, and that the alternative update rules of MCQ-L and Q( ) are more robust than standard Q-learning updates. 1",1994,11,1469,267,False,Computer Science,,3466704,Gavin Adrian Rummery,145387873.0,M.

Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets.

Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides. The best peptides identified through screening were found to have activities comparable or superior to those of four conventional antibiotics and superior to the peptide most advanced in clinical development against a broad array of multiresistant human pathogens.",2009,32,242,7,False,Biology,Medicine,2160852,C.
