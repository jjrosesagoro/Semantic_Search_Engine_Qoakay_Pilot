As these models get more and more complex, it also becomes harder for users to assess and trust their results, since their internal operations are mostly hidden in black boxes. The interpretation of machine learning models is currently a hot topic in the information visualization community, with results showing that insights from machine learning models can lead to better predictions and improve the trustworthiness of the results. Due to this, multiple (and extensive) survey articles have been published recently trying to summarize the high number of original research papers published on the topic. But there is not always a clear definition of what these surveys cover, what is the overlap between them, which types of machine learning models they deal with, or what exactly is the scenario that the readers will find in each of them. In this article, we present a meta-analysis (i.e. a “survey of surveys”) of manually collected survey papers that refer to the visual interpretation of machine learning models, including the papers discussed in the selected surveys. The aim of our article is to serve both as a detailed summary and as a guide through this survey ecosystem by acquiring, cataloging, and presenting fundamental knowledge of the state of the art and research opportunities in the area. Our results confirm the increasing trend of interpreting machine learning with visualizations in the past years, and that visualization can assist in, for example, online training processes of deep learning models and enhancing trust into machine learning. However, the question of exactly how this assistance should take place is still considered as an open challenge of the visualization community.",2020,101,60,3,True,Computer Science,52197250,Angelos Chatzimparmpas,47758081.0,R.

It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classification strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzy-logical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out.",2006,38,86,12,False,Computer Science,2064375222,Bernhard Moser,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most important factor affecting the budget of a project is the effort. Therefore, estimating effort is crucial because hiring people more than needed leads to a loss of income and hiring people less than needed leads to an extension of schedule. The main objective of this research is making an analysis of software effort estimation to overcome problems related to it: budget and schedule extension. To accomplish this, we propose a model that uses machine learning methods. We evaluate these models on public datasets and data gathered from software organizations in Turkey. It is found out in the experiments that the best method for a dataset may change and this proves the point that the usage of one model cannot always produce the best results.",2007,20,79,5,False,Computer Science,9390767,B.

To counter security threats posed by rogue or unknown transmitters, we must identify RF transmitters not only by the data content of the transmissions but also based on the intrinsic physical characteristics of the transmitters. RF waveforms represent a particular challenge because of the extremely high data rates involved and the potentially large number of transmitters sharing a channel in a given location. These factors outline the need for rapid fingerprinting and identification methods that go beyond the traditional hand-engineered approaches. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning strategies to the classification and identification problem. We evaluate four different strategies: conventional deep neural nets, convolutional neural nets, support vector machines, and deep neural nets with multi-stage training. The latter was by far the most accurate, achieving 100% classification accuracy of 12 transmitters, and showing remarkable potential for scalability to large transmitter populations.",2017,68,82,3,True,Computer Science,47226368,K.

Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that minimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently sequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative optimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring real-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric view of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We show a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for structured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of proximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems in image and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the exact optimization algorithms.",2012,64,175,14,False,Computer Science,2905900,P.

Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian (VB) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propagation algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectationmaximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM algorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models. It is shown how model selection tasks such as determining the dimensionality, cardinality, or number of variables are possible using VB approximations. Also explored are methods for combining sampling procedures with variational approximations, to estimate the tightness of VB bounds and to obtain more effective sampling algorithms. Chapter 6 applies VB learning to a long-standing problem of scoring discrete-variable directed acyclic graphs, and compares the performance to annealed importance sampling amongst other methods. Throughout, the VB approximation is compared to other methods including sampling, Cheeseman-Stutz, and asymptotic approximations such as BIC. The thesis concludes with a discussion of evolving directions for model selection including infinite models and alternative approximations to the marginal likelihood.",2003,166,1900,276,False,Computer Science,1773821,Matthew J.

In this domain, adversarial examples can be constructed by imperceptibly modifying images to cause misclassification, and are practical in the physical world. In contrast, current targeted adversarial examples applied to speech recognition systems have neither of these properties: humans can easily identify the adversarial perturbations, and they are not effective when played over-the-air. This paper makes advances on both of these fronts. First, we develop effectively imperceptible audio adversarial examples (verified through a human study) by leveraging the psychoacoustic principle of auditory masking, while retaining 100% targeted success rate on arbitrary full-sentence targets.

Introduction.-This note introduces some nonlinear difference-differential equations which can be interpreted as a learning theory or, alternatively, as a prediction theory whose goal is to discuss the prediction of individual events, in a fixed order, and at prescribed times. The theory provides a mathematical description of the following kind of experiment. An experimenter g, confronted by a machine MlZ, presents M with a list of ""letters"" or ""events"" to be learned. Suppose, for example, that g wishes to teach 9Mt the list of letters AB, or to predict the event B, given the event A. g does this by presenting A and then B to M several times. To find out if SE has learned the list as a result of these list presentations, the letter A alone is then presented to M. If M responds with the letter B, and M does this whenever A alone is said, then we have good evidence that MR has indeed learned the list AB. Thus M learns to predict the event B whenever the event A occurs as a result of repeated presentations of the list AB. We will introduce some mathematical machines that learn lists in the above manner. These machines have some properties that have a familiar intuitive interpretation. For example, in our simplest machine, it is possible to make rigorous the heuristic statements that (1) ""practice makes perfect,"" (2) an isolated system suffers no memory loss, (3) an isolated system remembers without practicing overtly, (4) the memory of an isolated system sometimes spontaneously improves without practice, (5) all errors can be corrected, although the rate of correction is sometimes diminished by response interference due to prior learning, (6) increasing the number of response alternatives sometimes diminishes the learning rate, and so on. All of the machines we will introduce possess the same dynamical laws. Nonetheless , the exact manner in which a given machine learns and remembers depends crucially on the particular way in which the components of the machine are interconnected ; i.e., on its ""geometry."" For example, properties (2) and (3) above do not hold in all the machines we shall describe. In this note, we will sketch some results for our simplest machine. These results, along with results for more complicated machines, are described in greater detail in another place.' 2.

This task is commonly referred to as requirements prioritization. This paper describes a requirements prioritization method called Case-Based Ranking (CBRank), which combines project's stakeholders preferences with requirements ordering approximations computed through machine learning techniques, bringing promising advantages. First, the human effort to input preference information can be reduced, while preserving the accuracy of the final ranking estimates. Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process. The techniques CBRank rests on and the associated prioritization process are detailed. Empirical evaluations of properties of CBRank are performed on simulated data and compared with a state-of-the-art prioritization method, providing evidence of the method ability to support the management of the tradeoff between elicitation effort and ranking accuracy and to exploit domain knowledge. A case study on a real software project complements these experimental measurements. Finally, a positioning of CBRank with respect to state-of-the-art requirements prioritization methods is proposed, together with a discussion of benefits and limits of the method.",2013,43,138,12,False,Computer Science,144124986,A.

However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.",2016,58,117,12,False,Computer Science,144537437,Aylin Caliskan,145315445.0,J.

We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions.

Recently, a new class of machine learning methods - namely, ranking methods, which are designed to directly optimize ranking performance - have been developed for ranking tasks such as web search that arise in information retrieval (IR) and other applications. Here we report the application of these new ranking methods in machine learning to the task of ranking chemical structures.

Objective To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phihookah-positive=0.39; phie-cigs-positive=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (χ2 4=414.50, P<.001, Cramer’s V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). Conclusions Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.",2013,47,299,16,False,Psychology,2913436,Mark Myslín,32010307.0,Shu-Hong Zhu,2640115.0,W.

In this scenario online learning seems the main way out, thanks to the possibility of adapting to changes in a smart and flexible way. Nevertheless, standard machine learning approaches usually suffer when confronted with massive amounts of data and when asked to work online. Online learning requires a high training and testing speed, all the more in place recognition, where a continuous flow of data comes from one or more cameras. In this paper we follow the Support Vector Machines-based approach of Pronobis et al., proposing an improvement that we call Online Independent Support Vector Machines. This technique exploits linear independence in the image feature space to incrementally keep the size of the learning machine remarkably small while retaining the accuracy of a standard machine. Since the training and testing time crucially depend on the size of the machine, this solves the above stated problems.

We then propose an outcome weighted learning approach based on the support vector machine framework. We show that the resulting estimator of the treatment rule is consistent. We further obtain a finite sample bound for the difference between the expected outcome using the estimated ITR and that of the optimal treatment rule.

Specifying goals and tasks for autonomous machines, such as robots, is a significant challenge: conventionally, reward functions and goal states have been used to communicate objectives. But people can communicate objectives to each other simply by describing or demonstrating them. How can we build learning algorithms that will allow us to tell machines what we want them to do? In this work, we investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our model learns rewards that transfer to novel tasks and environments on realistic, high-dimensional visual environments with natural language commands, whereas directly learning a language-conditioned policy leads to poor performance.",2019,29,81,3,False,Computer Science,2550764,Justin Fu,34786378.0,A.

A Theoretical Assessment (Part I),"An extreme learning machine (ELM) is a feedforward neural network (FNN) like learning system whose connections with output neurons are adjustable, while the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed. Numerous applications have demonstrated the feasibility and high efficiency of ELM-like systems. It has, however, been open if this is true for any general applications. In this two-part paper, we conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis of ELM. In Part I, we provide an answer to the question by theoretically justifying the following: 1) for some suitable activation functions, such as polynomials, Nadaraya-Watson and sigmoid functions, the ELM-like systems can attain the theoretical generalization bound of the FNNs with all connections adjusted, i.e., they do not degrade the generalization capability of the FNNs even when the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed; 2) the number of hidden neurons needed for an ELM-like system to achieve the theoretical bound can be estimated; and 3) whenever the activation function is taken as polynomial, the deduced hidden layer output matrix is of full column-rank, therefore the generalized inverse technique can be efficiently applied to yield the solution of an ELM-like system, and, furthermore, for the nonpolynomial case, the Tikhonov regularization can be applied to guarantee the weak regularity while not sacrificing the generalization capability. In Part II, however, we reveal a different aspect of the feasibility of ELM: there also exists some activation functions, which makes the corresponding ELM degrade the generalization capability. The obtained results underlie the feasibility and efficiency of ELM-like systems, and yield various generalizations and improvements of the systems as well.",2015,57,170,4,False,Mathematics,2110880625,Xia Liu,2432506.0,Shaobo Lin,2115378715.0,Jian Fang,98220533.0,Zongben Xu,Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern parallelization strategies employ fine-grained operations and scheduling beyond the classic bulk-synchronous processing paradigm popularized by MapReduce, or even specialized graph-based execution that relies on graph representations of ML programs. The variety of approaches tends to pull systems and algorithms design in different directions, and it remains difficult to find a universal platform applicable to a wide range of ML programs at scale. We propose a general-purpose framework, Petuum, that systematically addresses data- and model-parallel challenges in large-scale ML, by observing that many ML programs are fundamentally optimization-centric and admit error-tolerant, iterative-convergent algorithmic solutions. This presents unique opportunities for an integrative system design, such as bounded-error network synchronization and dynamic scheduling based on ML program structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of these system designs versus well-known implementations of modern ML algorithms, showing that Petuum allows ML programs to run in much less time and at considerably larger model sizes, even on modestly-sized compute clusters.",2013,74,468,48,True,Computer Science,143977260,E.

Recently, pixel/voxel-based ML (PML) emerged in medical image processing/analysis, which use pixel/voxel values in images directly instead of features calculated from segmented objects as input information; thus, feature calculation or segmentation is not required. Because the PML can avoid errors caused by inaccurate feature calculation and segmentation which often occur for subtle or complex objects, the performance of the PML can potentially be higher for such objects than that of common classifiers (i.e., feature-based MLs). In this paper, PMLs are surveyed to make clear (a) classes of PMLs, (b) similarities and differences within (among) different PMLs and those between PMLs and feature-based MLs, (c) advantages and limitations of PMLs, and (d) their applications in medical imaging.",2012,119,82,3,True,Computer Science,2118855751,Kenji Suzuki,,,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these problematic domains, planners can exploit domain-specific control knowledge to improve their performance in terms of both speed and quality of the solutions. However, manual definition of control knowledge is quite difficult. This paper reviews recent techniques in machine learning for the automatic definition of planning knowledge.

Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results. 
Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn. 
In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].",2014,193,521,42,False,Computer Science,1881041,Gilles Louppe,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the “Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors” image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we create a new weakly supervised ranking loss, which enables end-to-end learning of the architecture's parameters from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine.

In addition, multilayer neural networks surprisingly tend to achieve better performance when they are subject to an unsupervised pretraining. The booming of deep learning motivates researchers to identify the factors that contribute to its success. One possible reason identified is the flattening of manifold-shaped data in higher layers of neural networks. However, it is not clear how to measure the flattening of such manifold-shaped data and what amount of flattening a deep neural network can achieve. For the first time, this paper provides quantitative evidence to validate the flattening hypothesis.

To determine which machine learning classifier learns best to interpret standard automated perimetry (SAP) and to compare the best of the machine classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC 2 and with experts in glaucoma.


METHODS
Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG) classifiers were trained and tested by cross validation on the numerical plot of absolute sensitivity plus age of 189 normal eyes and 156 glaucomatous eyes, designated as such by the appearance of the optic nerve. The authors compared performance of these classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC, using the area under the ROC curve. Two human experts were judged against the machine classifiers and the global indices by plotting their sensitivity-specificity pairs.


RESULTS
MoG had the greatest area under the ROC curve of the machine classifiers. Pattern SD (PSD) and corrected PSD (CPSD) had the largest areas under the curve of the global indices. MoG had significantly greater ROC area than PSD and CPSD. Human experts were not better at classifying visual fields than the machine classifiers or the global indices.


CONCLUSIONS
MoG, using the entire visual field and age for input, interpreted SAP better than the global indices of STATPAC.

Data retrieved from malware samples, such as header fields, instruction sequences, or even raw bytes, is leveraged to learn models that discriminate between benign and malicious software. However, it has also been shown that machine learning and deep neural networks can be fooled by evasion attacks (also known as adversarial examples), i.e., small changes to the input data that cause misclassification at test time. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of malware detection methods that use deep networks to learn from raw bytes. We propose a gradient-based attack that is capable of evading a recently-proposed deep network suited to this purpose by only changing few specific bytes at the end of each mal ware sample, while preserving its intrusive functionality.

Classification through machine learning has the potential to improve search and filter tasks encompassing either complex or very specific information needs, individually. Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops.

To learn a well-performed hypothesis, a large amount of diagnosed samples are required. Although the samples can be easily collected from routine medical examinations, it is usually impossible for medical experts to make a diagnosis for each of the collected samples. If a hypothesis could be learned in the presence of a large amount of undiagnosed samples, the heavy burden on the medical experts could be released. In this paper, a new semisupervised learning algorithm named Co-Forest is proposed. It extends the co-training paradigm by using a well-known ensemble method named Random Forest, which enables Co-Forest to estimate the labeling confidence of undiagnosed samples and easily produce the final hypothesis. Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on three medical data sets and a successful application to microcalcification detection for breast cancer diagnosis show that undiagnosed samples are helpful in building CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance of the hypothesis that is learned on only a small amount of diagnosed samples by utilizing the available undiagnosed samples.",2007,53,338,40,False,Computer Science,40655383,Ming Li,145624000.0,Zhi-Hua Zhou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk of overfitting and of selection bias effects is pervasive: not only potential features easily outnumber samples by 10(3) times, but it is easy to neglect information-leakage effects during preprocessing from spectra to peaks. The aim of this review is to explain how to build a general purpose design analysis protocol (DAP) for predictive proteomic profiling: we show how to limit leakage due to parameter tuning and how to organize classification and ranking on large numbers of replicate versions of the original data to avoid selection bias. The DAP can be used with alternative components, i.e. with different preprocessing methods (peak clustering or wavelet based), classifiers e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM) or feature ranking methods (recursive feature elimination or I-Relief).

Unfortunately, the promise of machine learning has been slow to materialize in the network security domain. In this paper, we highlight two primary reasons why this is the case: inaccurate ground truth and a highly non-stationary data distribution. To demonstrate and understand the effect that these pitfalls have on popular machine learning algorithms, we design and carry out experiments that show how six common algorithms perform when confronted with real network data. With our experimental results, we identify the situations in which certain classes of algorithms underperform on the task of encrypted malware traffic classification. We offer concrete recommendations for practitioners given the real-world constraints outlined. From an algorithmic perspective, we find that the random forest ensemble method outperformed competing methods. More importantly, feature engineering was decisive; we found that iterating on the initial feature set, and including features suggested by domain experts, had a much greater impact on the performance of the classification system. For example, linear regression using the more expressive feature set easily outperformed the random forest method using a standard network traffic representation on all criteria considered.

Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1% FBCSP, 84.0% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task‐related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG‐based brain mapping.

As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)‐based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network‐based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS‐based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL‐based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection.

Nevertheless, instances of machine learning offering new insights have been rare up to now. Here we show that a single feed-forward neural network can decode the defining structures of two distinct MBL phases and a thermalizing phase, using entanglement spectra obtained from individual eigenstates. For this, we introduce a simplicial geometry-based method for extracting multipartite phase boundaries. We find that this method outperforms conventional metrics for identifying MBL phase transitions, revealing a sharper phase boundary and shedding new insight on the topology of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the phase diagram we acquire from a single disorder configuration confirms that the machine-learning-based approach we establish here can enable speedy exploration of large phase spaces that can assist with the discovery of new MBL phases.

Current solutions for anatomy detection are typically based on machine learning techniques that exploit large annotated image databases in order to learn the appearance of the captured anatomy. These solutions are subject to several limitations, including the use of suboptimal feature engineering techniques and most importantly the use of computationally suboptimal search-schemes for anatomy detection. To address these issues, we propose a method that follows a new paradigm by reformulating the detection problem as a behavior learning task for an artificial agent. We couple the modeling of the anatomy appearance and the object search in a unified behavioral framework, using the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and multi-scale image analysis. In other words, an artificial agent is trained not only to distinguish the target anatomical object from the rest of the body but also how to find the object by learning and following an optimal navigation path to the target object in the imaged volumetric space. We evaluated our approach on 1487 3D-CT volumes from 532 patients, totaling over 500,000 image slices and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on detecting several anatomical structures with no failed cases from a clinical acceptance perspective, while also achieving a 20-30 percent higher detection accuracy.

In this paper, a classification paradigm to exploit rich texture information of HSI is proposed. The proposed framework employs local binary patterns (LBPs) to extract local image features, such as edges, corners, and spots. Two levels of fusion (i.e., feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion) are applied to the extracted LBP features along with global Gabor features and original spectral features, where feature-level fusion involves concatenation of multiple features before the pattern classification process while decision-level fusion performs on probability outputs of each individual classification pipeline and soft-decision fusion rule is adopted to merge results from the classifier ensemble. Moreover, the efficient extreme learning machine with a very simple structure is employed as the classifier.

Mimicking the same behavior on machine learning vision systems is an interesting and very challenging research problem with many practical advantages on real world vision applications. In this context, the goal of our work is to devise a few-shot visual learning system that during test time it will be able to efficiently learn novel categories from only a few training data while at the same time it will not forget the initial categories on which it was trained (here called base categories). To achieve that goal we propose (a) to extend an object recognition system with an attention based few-shot classification weight generator, and (b) to redesign the classifier of a ConvNet model as the cosine similarity function between feature representations and classification weight vectors. The latter, apart from unifying the recognition of both novel and base categories, it also leads to feature representations that generalize better on ""unseen"" categories. We extensively evaluate our approach on Mini-ImageNet where we manage to improve the prior state-of-the-art on few-shot recognition (i.e., we achieve 56.20% and 73.00% on the 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively) while at the same time we do not sacrifice any accuracy on the base categories, which is a characteristic that most prior approaches lack.

A typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge of the network, i.e., close to the IoT devices where the data is generated. Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources.

Metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra is an important problem in metabolomics, underpinning subsequent metabolic modelling and network analysis. Yet, currently this task requires matching the observed spectrum against a database of reference spectra originating from similar equipment and closely matching operating parameters, a condition that is rarely satisfied in public repositories. Furthermore, the computational support for identification of molecules not present in reference databases is lacking. Recent efforts in assembling large public mass spectral databases such as MassBank have opened the door for the development of a new genre of metabolite identification methods.


RESULTS
We introduce a novel framework for prediction of molecular characteristics and identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra using machine learning with the support vector machine. Our approach is to first predict a large set of molecular properties of the unknown metabolite from salient tandem mass spectral signals, and in the second step to use the predicted properties for matching against large molecule databases, such as PubChem. We demonstrate that several molecular properties can be predicted to high accuracy and that they are useful in de novo metabolite identification, where the reference database does not contain any spectra of the same molecule.

In this work, we propose an attention-based neural network model for joint intent detection and slot filling, both of which are critical steps for many speech understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in machine translation and speech recognition, alignment is explicit in slot filling. We explore different strategies in incorporating this alignment information to the encoder-decoder framework. Learning from the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we further propose introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such attentions provide additional information to the intent classification and slot label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art intent detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark ATIS task.

We consider a bandwidth-limited fading multiple access channel (MAC) from the wireless devices to the PS, and propose various techniques to implement distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) over this shared noisy wireless channel. We first propose a digital DSGD (D-DSGD) scheme, in which one device is selected opportunistically for transmission at each iteration based on the channel conditions; the scheduled device quantizes its gradient estimate to a finite number of bits imposed by the channel condition, and transmits these bits to the PS in a reliable manner. Next, motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose a novel analog communication scheme, referred to as the compressed analog DSGD (CA-DSGD), where the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates while accumulating error from previous iterations, and project the resultant sparse vector into a low-dimensional vector for bandwidth reduction. We also design a power allocation scheme to align the received gradient vectors at the PS in an efficient manner. Numerical results show that D-DSGD outperforms other digital approaches in the literature; however, in general the proposed CA-DSGD algorithm converges faster than the D-DSGD scheme, and reaches a higher level of accuracy. We have observed that the gap between the analog and digital schemes increases when the datasets of devices are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore, the performance of the CA-DSGD scheme is shown to be robust against imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Overall these results show clear advantages for the proposed analog over-the-air DSGD scheme, which suggests that learning and communication algorithms should be designed jointly to achieve the best end-to-end performance in machine learning applications at the wireless edge.",2019,39,274,22,True,Computer Science,2240170,M.

The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy?

The tree can then be translated into a set of rules for an expert system. Two extensions to GID3MmRIST, and KARSM-that deal with the problems of noisy data and the limited availability of training data are discussed. The application of GID3 to reactive ion etching manufacturing process diagnosis and optimization and to knowledge acquisition for an expert system is described.<<ETX>>",1993,9,85,0,False,Computer Science,34849755,K.

The Deep Generative Deconvolutional Network (DGDN) is used as a decoder of the latent image features, and a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an image encoder; the CNN is used to approximate a distribution for the latent DGDN features/code. The latent code is also linked to generative models for labels (Bayesian support vector machine) or captions (recurrent neural network). When predicting a label/caption for a new image at test, averaging is performed across the distribution of latent codes; this is computationally efficient as a consequence of the learned CNN-based encoder. Since the framework is capable of modeling the image in the presence/absence of associated labels/captions, a new semi-supervised setting is manifested for CNN learning with images; the framework even allows unsupervised CNN learning, based on images alone.",2016,37,537,21,False,Computer Science,2750075,Yunchen Pu,144702900.0,Zhe Gan,145153424.0,Ricardo Henao,50242822.0,Xin Yuan,Mathematics,2109737569.0,Chunyuan Li,9074631.0,Andrew Stevens,145006560.0,L.

New conference venues and academic journals have emerged to promote the proliferating research; however, the translational path remains unclear. This review undertakes the first in-depth study to identify how machine learning models that ingest structured electronic health record data can be applied to clinical decision support tasks and translated into clinical practice. The authors complement their own work with the experience of 21 machine learning products that address problems across clinical domains and across geographic populations. Four phases of translation emerge: design and develop, evaluate and validate, diffuse and scale, and continuing monitoring and maintenance. The review highlights the varying approaches taken across each phase by teams building machine learning products and presents a discussion of challenges and opportunities. The translational path and associated findings are instructive to researchers and developers building machine learning products, policy makers regulating machine learning products, and health system leaders who are considering adopting a machine learning product.",2020,120,52,1,True,,47057856,M.

This is often inefficient even with recent advances in the efficient training of the (supervised) SVM. In this paper, we show that S3VMs, with knowledge of the means of the class labels of the unlabeled data, is closely related to the supervised SVM with known labels on all the unlabeled data. This motivates us to first estimate the label means of the unlabeled data. Two versions of the meanS3VM, which work by maximizing the margin between the label means, are proposed. The first one is based on multiple kernel learning, while the second one is based on alternating optimization. Experiments show that both of the proposed algorithms achieve highly competitive and sometimes even the best performance as compared to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learners. Moreover, they are more efficient than existing S3VMs.",2009,21,97,11,False,Computer Science,2110463675,Yu-Feng Li,145193332.0,J.

Many conventional active learning algorithms focus on refining the decision boundary, at the expense of exploring new regions that the current hypothesis misclassifies. We propose a new active learning algorithm that balances such exploration with refining of the decision boundary by dynamically adjusting the probability to explore at each step. Our experimental results demonstrate improved performance on data sets that require extensive exploration while remaining competitive on data sets that do not. Our algorithm also shows significant tolerance of noise.",2005,22,137,16,True,Computer Science,31621435,T. T. Osugi,2068921800.0,Kun Deng,93847855.0,S.

Motor primitives offer one of the most promising frameworks for the application of machine learning techniques in this context. Employing an improved form of the dynamic systems motor primitives originally introduced by Ijspeert et al. [2], we show how both discrete and rhythmic tasks can be learned using a concerted approach of both imitation and reinforcement learning. For doing so, we present both learning algorithms and representations targeted for the practical application in robotics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to include a start-up phase in rhythmic primitives. We show that two new motor skills, i.e., Ball-in-a-Cup and Ball-Paddling, can be learned on a real Barrett WAM robot arm at a pace similar to human learning while achieving a significantly more reliable final performance.",2009,29,229,16,False,Computer Science,145739642,J.

Traditionally models have assumed workers are homogenous inputs. However, in practice, substantial variability in productivity means the marginal productivity of labor depends substantially on which new workers are hired--which requires not an estimate of a causal effect, but rather a prediction. We demonstrate that there can be large social welfare gains from using machine learning tools to predict worker productivity, using data from two important applications - police hiring and teacher tenure decisions.",2016,32,129,3,True,Economics,69466219,Aaron Chalfin,52544059.0,Oren Danieli,122036781.0,A.
