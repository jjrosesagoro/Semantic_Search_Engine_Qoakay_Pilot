This raises the question of which tasks will be most affected by ML. We apply the rubric evaluating task potential for ML in Brynjolfsson and Mitchell (2017) to build measures of ""Suitability for Machine Learning"" (SML) and apply it to 18,156 tasks in O*NET.

Although human movements are encoded in a sequence of successive samples in time, typical machine learning methods perform recognition tasks without exploiting the temporal correlations between input data samples. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) address this issue by using convolutions across a one-dimensional temporal sequence to capture dependencies among input data. However, the size of convolutional kernels restricts the captured range of dependencies between data samples. As a result, typical models are unadaptable to a wide range of activity-recognition configurations and require fixed-length input windows. In this paper, we propose the use of deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) for building recognition models that are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. We present unidirectional, bidirectional, and cascaded architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) DRNNs and evaluate their effectiveness on miscellaneous benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform methods employing conventional machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

Discovery of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace; new agents often suffer from cross-resistance to existing agents of similar structure. Short, cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity are essential to the host defenses of many organisms and represent a promising new class of antimicrobials. This paper reports the successful in silico screening for potent antibiotic peptides using a combination of QSAR and machine learning techniques. On the basis of initial high-throughput measurements of activity of over 1400 random peptides, artificial neural network models were built using QSAR descriptors and subsequently used to screen an in silico library of approximately 100,000 peptides. In vitro validation of the modeling showed 94% accuracy in identifying highly active peptides.

The ML models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a threat. Several prediction methods are being popularly used to handle forecasting problems. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 which is presently considered as a potential threat to mankind. In particular, four standard forecasting models, such as linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and exponential smoothing (ES) have been used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. Three types of predictions are made by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days. The results produced by the study proves it a promising mechanism to use these methods for the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results prove that the ES performs best among all the used models followed by LR and LASSO which performs well in forecasting the new confirmed cases, death rate as well as recovery rate, while SVM performs poorly in all the prediction scenarios given the available dataset.",2020,26,240,13,True,Computer Science,1430656665,Furqan Rustam,9341675.0,A.

Most previous work has only considered the refinement of the network's conditional probability parameters and has not addressed the issue of refining the network's structure. We tackle this problem by a machine learning approach based on a formalism known as the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle is well suited to this task since it can perform tradeoffs between the accuracy, simplicity, and closeness to the existent structure. Another salient feature of this refinement approach is the capability of refining a network structure using partially specified data.

Two main goals were achieved from the automation process. One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur’anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever.",2005,42,136,1,False,Computer Science,1697090,B.

Techniques based on machine learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically relevant space of configurations has remained a challenging goal. Here we present a Gaussian Approximation Potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density functional theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations that would be extremely expensive with a first principles electronic structure method, such as finite temperature phase boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid, formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture. We show that the uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential's accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively describes a material, and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.",2018,218,218,7,True,Physics,3938091,A.

This translation approach allows for general many-to-many relations between words. Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly. The model is described using a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source-channel approach. Thereby, the model is easier to extend than classical statistical machine translation systems. We describe in detail the process for learning phrasal translations, the feature functions used, and the search algorithm. The evaluation of this approach is performed on three different tasks. For the German-English speech Verbmobil task, we analyze the effect of various system components. On the French-English Canadian Hansards task, the alignment template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model.

Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.",2018,15,215,11,True,Computer Science,2151683198,M.

It is typically used in settings where $f$ is expensive to evaluate. A common use case for BO in machine learning is model selection, where it is not possible to analytically model the generalisation performance of a statistical model, and we resort to noisy and expensive training and validation procedures to choose the best model. Conventional BO methods have focused on Euclidean and categorical domains, which, in the context of model selection, only permits tuning scalar hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. However, with the surge of interest in deep learning, there is an increasing demand to tune neural network \emph{architectures}. In this work, we develop NASBOT, a Gaussian process based BO framework for neural architecture search. To accomplish this, we develop a distance metric in the space of neural network architectures which can be computed efficiently via an optimal transport program. This distance might be of independent interest to the deep learning community as it may find applications outside of BO. We demonstrate that NASBOT outperforms other alternatives for architecture search in several cross validation based model selection tasks on multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.",2018,60,411,35,False,Mathematics,1887808,Kirthevasan Kandasamy,2934259.0,W.

This has resulted in its practical use for either primary detection engines or for supplementary heuristic detection by anti-malware vendors. Recent work in adversarial machine learning has shown that deep learning models are susceptible to gradient-based attacks, whereas non-differentiable models that report a score can be attacked by genetic algorithms that aim to systematically reduce the score. We propose a more general framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) for attacking static portable executable (PE) anti-malware engines. The general framework does not require a differentiable model nor does it require the engine to produce a score. Instead, an RL agent is equipped with a set of functionality-preserving operations that it may perform on the PE file. Through a series of games played against the anti-malware engine, it learns which sequences of operations are likely to result in evading the detector for any given malware sample. This enables completely black-box attacks against static PE anti-malware, and produces functional evasive malware samples as a direct result. We show in experiments that our method can attack a gradient-boosted machine learning model with evasion rates that are substantial and appear to be strongly dependent on the dataset. We demonstrate that attacks against this model appear to also evade components of publicly hosted antivirus engines. Adversarial training results are also presented: by retraining the model on evasive ransomware samples, a subsequent attack is 33% less effective. However, there are overfitting dangers when adversarial training, which we note.

 End-user interactive machine learning is a promising tool for enhancing human productivity and capabilities with large unstructured data sets. Recent work has shown that we can create end-user interactive machine learning systems for specific applications.

 However,this model does not directly support processing multiple related heterogeneous datasets. While processing relational data is a common need, this limitation causes difficulties and/or inefficiency when Map-Reduce is applied on relational operations like joins.
 We improve Map-Reduce into a new model called Map-Reduce-Merge.

Yet few datacenters are automated this way in practice, due in part to well-founded skepticism about whether the simple models often used in the research literature can capture complex real-life workload/performance relationships and keep up with changing conditions that might invalidate the models. We argue that these shortcomings can be fixed by importing modeling, control, and analysis techniques from statistics and machine learning.

This new learning algorithm can be seen as an alternative training technique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. An interesting property of this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle. The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its relationship with SRM, and its geometrical insight, are discussed in this paper. Training a SVM is equivalent to solve a quadratic programming problem with linear and box constraints in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. When the number of data points exceeds few thousands the problem is very challenging, because the quadratic form is completely dense, so the memory needed to store the problem grows with the square of the number of data points. Therefore, training problems arising in some real applications with large data sets are impossible to load into memory, and cannot be solved using standard non-linear constrained optimization algorithms. We present a decomposition algorithm that can be used to train SVM''s over large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present previous approaches, as well as results and important details of our implementation of the algorithm using a second-order variant of the Reduced Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems.

For instance, empirically successful algorithms such as C4:5 and backpropagation have not met the criteria of the PAC model and its variants. Conversely, the algorithms suggested by computational learning theory are usually too limited in various ways to nd wide application. The theoretical status of decision tree learning algorithms is a case in point: while it has been proven that C4:5 (and all reasonable variants of it) fails to meet the PAC model criteria [2], other recently proposed decision tree algorithms that do have non-trivial performance guarantees unfortunately require membership queries [6, 13]. Two recent developments have narrowed this gap between theory and practice|not for the PAC model, but for the related model known as weak learning or boosting . First, an algorithm called Adaboost was proposed that meets the formal criteria of the boosting model and is also competitive in practice [10]. Second, the basic algorithms underlying the popular C4:5 and CART programs have also very recently been shown to meet the formal criteria of the boosting model [12]. Thus, it seems plausible that the weak learning framework may provide a setting for interaction between formal analysis and machine learning practice that is lacking in other theoretical models. Our aim in this paper is to push this interaction further in light of these recent developments. In particular, we perform experiments suggested by the formal results for Adaboost and C4:5 within the weak learning framework. We concentrate on two particularly intriguing issues. First, the theoretical boosting results for top-down decision tree algorithms such as C4:5 [12] suggest that a new splitting criterion may result in trees that are smaller and more accurate than those obtained using the usual information gain. We con rm this suggestion experimentally. Second, a super cial interpretation of the theoretical results suggests that Adaboost should vastly outperform C4:5. This is not the case in practice, and we argue through experimental results that the theory must be understood in terms of a measure of a boosting algorithm's behavior called its advantage sequence. We compare the advantage sequences for C4:5 and Adaboost in a number of experiments. We nd that these sequences have qualitatively different behavior that explains in large part the discrepancies between empirical performance and the theoretical results. Brie y, we nd that although C4:5 and Adaboost are both boosting algorithms, Adaboost creates successively \harder"" ltered distributions, while C4:5 creates successively \easier"" ones, in a sense that will be made precise.",1996,19,114,3,False,Computer Science,144299726,Thomas G.

In particular, guaranteed monotonicity of the learned function with respect to some of the inputs can be critical for user confidence. We propose meeting these goals for low-dimensional machine learning problems by learning flexible, monotonic functions using calibrated interpolated look-up tables. We extend the structural risk minimization framework of lattice regression to monotonic functions by adding linear inequality constraints. In addition, we propose jointly learning interpretable calibrations of each feature to normalize continuous features and handle categorical or missing data, at the cost of making the objective non-convex. We address large-scale learning through parallelization, mini-batching, and random sampling of additive regularizer terms. Case studies on real-world problems with up to sixteen features and up to hundreds of millions of training samples demonstrate the proposed monotonic functions can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in practice while providing greater transparency to users.",2015,78,101,3,False,Computer Science,2109834931,Maya R.

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions.",2006,41,843,89,True,Medicine,145984136,A. Agarwal,1756114.0,B.

Discovering patterns and structures in large troves of data in an automated manner is a core component of data science, and currently drives applications in diverse areas such as computational biology, law and finance. However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with a significant challenge: how do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them? In this report, we focus specifically on data-driven methods—machine learning (ML) and pattern recognition models in particular—so as to survey and distill the results and observations from the literature. The purpose of this report can be especially appreciated by noting that ML models are increasingly deployed in a wide range of businesses. However, with the increasing prevalence and complexity of methods, business stakeholders in the very least have a growing number of concerns about the drawbacks of models, data-specific biases, and so on. Analogously, data science practitioners are often not aware about approaches emerging from the academic literature or may struggle to appreciate the differences between different methods, so end up using industry standards such as SHAP. Here, we have undertaken a survey to help industry practitioners (but also data scientists more broadly) understand the field of explainable machine learning better and apply the right tools. Our latter sections build a narrative around a putative data scientist, and discuss how she might go about explaining her models by asking the right questions.

Introduction Recommender systems provide advice to users about items they might wish to purchase or examine. Recommendations made by such systems can help users navigate through large information spaces of product descriptions, news articles or other items. As on-line information and e-commerce burgeon, recommender systems are an increasingly important tool. A recent survey of recommender systems is found in The most well known type of recommender system is the collaborative-or social-filtering type. These systems aggregate data about customers' purchasing habits or preferences, and make recommendations to other users based on similarity in overall purchasing patterns. For example, in the Ringo music recommender system (Shardanand & Maes, 1995), users express their musical preferences by rating various artists and albums, and get suggestions of groups and recordings that others with similar preferences also liked. Content-based recommender systems are classifier systems derived from machine learning research. For example, the NewsDude news filtering system is a recommender system that suggests news stories the user might like to read (Billsus & Pazzani, 1999). These systems use supervised machine learning to induce a classifier that can discriminate between items likely to be of interest to the user and those likely to be uninteresting. A third type of recommender system is one that uses knowledge about users and products to pursue a knowledge-based approach to generating a recommendation, reasoning about what products meet the user's requirements. The PersonalLogic recom-mender system offers a dialog that effectively walks the user down a discrimination tree of product features.",2000,28,884,58,False,Computer Science,1747150,R.

Accurately predicting stroke outcome from a set of predictive variables may identify high-risk patients and guide treatment approaches, leading to decreased morbidity. Logistic regression models allow for the identification and validation of predictive variables. However, advanced machine learning algorithms offer an alternative, in particular, for large-scale multi-institutional data, with the advantage of easily incorporating newly available data to improve prediction performance. Our aim was to design and compare different machine learning methods, capable of predicting the outcome of endovascular intervention in acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke. Method We conducted a retrospective study of a prospectively collected database of acute ischaemic stroke treated by endovascular intervention. Using SPSS®, MATLAB®, and Rapidminer®, classical statistics as well as artificial neural network and support vector algorithms were applied to design a supervised machine capable of classifying these predictors into potential good and poor outcomes. These algorithms were trained, validated and tested using randomly divided data. Results We included 107 consecutive acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients treated by endovascular technique. Sixty-six were male and the mean age of 65.3. All the available demographic, procedural and clinical factors were included into the models. The final confusion matrix of the neural network, demonstrated an overall congruency of ∼80% between the target and output classes, with favourable receiving operative characteristics.

This motivates us to introduce in this paper the Wilcoxon approach to the area of machine learning. Specifically, we investigate four new learning machines, namely Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), Wilcoxon generalized radial basis function network (WGRBFN), Wilcoxon fuzzy neural network (WFNN), and kernel-based Wilcoxon regressor (KWR). These provide alternative learning machines when faced with general nonlinear learning problems. Simple weights updating rules based on gradient descent will be derived. Some numerical examples will be provided to compare the robustness against outliers for various learning machines. Simulation results show that the Wilcoxon learning machines proposed in this paper have good robustness against outliers.

In the 1980s, knowledge-based techniques also made an impressive contribution to “intelligent” information retrieval and indexing. More recently, information science researchers have turned to other newer artificial-intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. These newer techniques, which are grounded on diverse paradigms, have provided great opportunities for researchers to enhance the information processing and retrieval capabilities of current information storage and retrieval systems. In this article, we first provide an overview of these newer techniques and their use in information science research. To familiarize readers with these techniques, we present three popular methods: the connectionist Hopfield network; the symbolic ID3/ID5R; and evolution-based genetic algorithms. We discuss their knowledge representations and algorithms in the context of information retrieval. Sample implementation and testing results from our own research are also provided for each technique. We believe these techniques are promising in their ability to analyze user queries, identify users' information needs, and suggest alternatives for search. With proper user-system interactions, these methods can greatly complement the prevailing full-text, keyword-based, probabilistic, and knowledge-based techniques. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1995,112,306,20,True,Computer Science,47666658,Hsinchun Chen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods.

Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain–computer interfaces, BCI’s), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.",2019,187,527,30,False,Physics,1411706241,Alexander Craik,2517432.0,Yongtian He,1398582662.0,J.

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.",2002,31,4391,688,False,Computer Science,1680188,T.

We examine training at reduced precision, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and ask: is it possible to train models at end-to-end low precision with provable guarantees? Can this lead to consistent order-ofmagnitude speedups? We mainly focus on linear models, and the answer is yes for linear models. We develop a simple framework called ZipML based on one simple but novel strategy called double sampling. Our ZipML framework is able to execute training at low precision with no bias, guaranteeing convergence, whereas naive quantization would introduce significant bias. We validate our framework across a range of applications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to 6.5× faster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a variance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a significant difference in a variety of settings. When applied to linear models together with double sampling, we save up to another 1.7× in data movement compared with uniform quantization. When training deep networks with quantized models, we achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-theart XNOR-Net.

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas.

 The inherent nature of social media content poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.

Its competitive performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification) or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well. Naive Bayes and Augmented Naive Bayes Classification is a fundamental issue in machine learning and data mining. In classification, the goal of a learning algorithm is to construct a classifier given a set of training examples with class labels. Typically, an example E is represented by a tuple of attribute values (x1, x2, , · · · , xn), where xi is the value of attribute Xi. Let C represent the classification variable, and let c be the value of C. In this paper, we assume that there are only two classes: + (the positive class) or − (the negative class). A classifier is a function that assigns a class label to an example. From the probability perspective, according to Bayes Copyright c © 2004, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. Rule, the probability of an example E = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) being class c is p(c|E) = p(E|c)p(c) p(E) . E is classified as the class C = + if and only if fb(E) = p(C = +|E) p(C = −|E) ≥ 1, (1) where fb(E) is called a Bayesian classifier.

Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.",2018,88,614,55,False,Computer Science,1403746185,S.

One of the goals of genomic medicine is to determine how variations in the DNA of individuals can affect the risk of different diseases, and to find causal explanations so that targeted therapies can be designed. Here we focus on how machine learning can help to model the relationship between DNA and the quantities of key molecules in the cell, with the premise that these quantities, which we refer to as cell variables, may be associated with disease risks. Modern biology allows high-throughput measurement of many such cell variables, including gene expression, splicing, and proteins binding to nucleic acids, which can all be treated as training targets for predictive models.

The objective of dimension reduction algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), random projection (RP), and auto-encoder (AE), is to reduce the noise or irrelevant information of the data. The features of PCA (eigenvectors) and linear AE are not able to represent data as parts (e.g. nose in a face image). On the other hand, NMF and non-linear AE are maimed by slow learning speed and RP only represents a subspace of original data. This paper introduces a dimension reduction framework which to some extend represents data as parts, has fast learning speed, and learns the between-class scatter subspace. To this end, this paper investigates a linear and non-linear dimension reduction framework referred to as extreme learning machine AE (ELM-AE) and sparse ELM-AE (SELM-AE). In contrast to tied weight AE, the hidden neurons in ELM-AE and SELM-AE need not be tuned, and their parameters (e.g, input weights in additive neurons) are initialized using orthogonal and sparse random weights, respectively. Experimental results on USPS handwritten digit recognition data set, CIFAR-10 object recognition, and NORB object recognition data set show the efficacy of linear and non-linear ELM-AE and SELM-AE in terms of discriminative capability, sparsity, training time, and normalized mean square error.",2016,60,137,12,False,Mathematics,2996971,L.

MRI characteristics of brain gliomas have been used to predict clinical outcome and molecular tumor characteristics. However, previously reported imaging biomarkers have not been sufficiently accurate or reproducible to enter routine clinical practice and often rely on relatively simple MRI measures. The current study leverages advanced image analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify complex and reproducible imaging patterns predictive of overall survival and molecular subtype in glioblastoma (GB).


METHODS
One hundred five patients with GB were first used to extract approximately 60 diverse features from preoperative multiparametric MRIs. These imaging features were used by a machine learning algorithm to derive imaging predictors of patient survival and molecular subtype. Cross-validation ensured generalizability of these predictors to new patients. Subsequently, the predictors were evaluated in a prospective cohort of 29 new patients.


RESULTS
Survival curves yielded a hazard ratio of 10.64 for predicted long versus short survivors. The overall, 3-way (long/medium/short survival) accuracy in the prospective cohort approached 80%. Classification of patients into the 4 molecular subtypes of GB achieved 76% accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
By employing machine learning techniques, we were able to demonstrate that imaging patterns are highly predictive of patient survival. Additionally, we found that GB subtypes have distinctive imaging phenotypes. These results reveal that when imaging markers related to infiltration, cell density, microvascularity, and blood-brain barrier compromise are integrated via advanced pattern analysis methods, they form very accurate predictive biomarkers. These predictive markers used solely preoperative images, hence they can significantly augment diagnosis and treatment of GB patients.",2016,43,237,8,True,Medicine,5658385,L. Macyszyn,1836349.0,H.

Experiments were performed on Kinect Activity Recognition Dataset, a new dataset, and on CAD-60, a public dataset. Experimental results show that our solution outperforms four relevant works based on RGB-D image fusion, hierarchical Maximum Entropy Markov Model, Markov Random Fields, and Eigenjoints, respectively.

We show that this kernel is positive definite and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance.

The article reports on experiments in which support vector machines (SVMs) are employed to recognize translated text in a corpus of Italian articles from the geopolitical domain. An ensemble of SVMs reaches 86.7% accuracy with 89.3% precision and 83.3% recall on this task. A preliminary analysis of the features used by the SVMs suggests that the distribution of function words and morphosyntactic categories in general, and personal pronouns and adverbs in particular, are among the cues used by the SVMs to perform the discrimination task. A follow-up experiment shows that the performance attained by SVMs is well above the average performance of ten human subjects, including five professional translators, on the same task. Our results offer solid evidence supporting the translationese hypothesis, and our method seems to have promising applications in translation studies and in quantitative style analysis in general. Implications for the machine learning/text categorization community are equally important, both because this is a novel application and especially because we provide explicit evidence that a relatively knowledge-poor machine learning algorithm can outperform human beings in a text classification task.",2005,42,188,14,False,Computer Science,145283199,Marco Baroni,46715576.0,Silvia Bernardini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach is based on identifying and annotating uncertain samples. The uncertainty value of each sample is measured by its conditional error. The approach takes advantage of current classifiers' probability preserving and ordering properties. It calibrates the output scores of classifiers to conditional error. Thus, it can estimate the uncertainty value for each input sample according to its output score from a classifier and select only samples with uncertainty value above a user-defined threshold. Even though we cannot guarantee the optimality of the proposed approach, we find it to provide good performance. Compared with existing methods, this approach is robust without additional computational effort. A new active learning method for support vector machines (SVMs) is implemented following this approach. A dynamic bin width allocation method is proposed to accurately estimate sample conditional error and this method adapts to the underlying probabilities.
