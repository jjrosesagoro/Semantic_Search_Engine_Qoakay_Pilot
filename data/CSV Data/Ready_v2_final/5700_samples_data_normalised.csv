An important disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield. We identify a number of parameters that influence the obtainable speedups, and validate and refine our analysis with experiments on a variety of data sets with two different implementations. Besides cross-validation, we also briefly explore the usefulness of these techniques for bagging. We conclude with some guidelines concerning when these optimizations should be considered.",2001,23,149,13,False,Computer Science,1755851,H.

For this task a key enabler is a robust detection and classification of the plant and species. Automatically distinguishing between plant species is a challenging task, because some species look very similar. It is also difficult to translate the symbolic high level description of the appearances and the differences between the plants used by humans, into a formal, computer understandable form. Also it is not possible to reliably detect structures, like leaves and branches in 3D data provided by our sensor. One approach to solve this problem is to learn how to classify the species by using a set of example plants and machine learning methods. In this paper we are introducing a method for distinguishing plant species using a 3D LIDAR sensor and supervised learning. For that we have developed a set of size and rotation invariant features and evaluated experimentally which are the most descriptive ones. Besides these features we have also compared different learning methods using the toolbox Weka. It turned out that the best methods for our application are simple logistic regression functions, support vector machines and neural networks. In our experiments we used six different plant species, typically available at common nurseries, and about 20 examples of each species. In the laboratory we were able to identify over 98% of these plants correctly.",2010,15,49,3,True,Computer Science,2052869067,Ulrich Weiss,1491174572.0,P. Biber,,,3220215.0,Stefan Laible,1735789.0,K.

While this enables reducing the training time, the observed speed up is often limited by network bottlenecks. To address this, we design MLNET, a host-based communication layer that aims to improve the network performance of distributed machine learning systems. This is achieved through a combination of traffic reduction techniques (to diminish network load in the core and at the edges) and traffic management (to reduce average training time). A key feature of MLNET is its compatibility with existing hardware and software infrastructure so it can be immediately deployed. We describe the main techniques underpinning MLNET and show through simulation that the overall training time can be reduced by up to 78%. While preliminary, our results indicate the critical role played by the network and the benefits of introducing a new communication layer to increase the performance of distributed machine learning systems.",2015,43,50,4,False,Computer Science,32214483,Luo Mai,2107093521.0,C.

This paper introduces a new machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) toolbox into the scientific Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator (ARTMO) software package. ARTMO facilitates retrieval of biophysical parameters from remote observations in a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) environment. The MLRA toolbox enables analyzing the predictive power of various MLRAs in a semiautomatic and systematic manner, and applying a selected MLRA to multispectral or hyperspectral imagery for mapping applications. It contains both linear and nonlinear state-of-the-art regression algorithms, in particular linear feature extraction via principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision trees (DTs), neural networks (NNs), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The performance of multiple implemented regression strategies has been evaluated against the SPARC dataset (Barrax, Spain) and simulated Sentinel-2 (8 bands), CHRIS (62 bands) and HyMap (125 bands) observations. In general, nonlinear regression algorithms (NN, KRR, and GPR) outperformed linear techniques (PCR and PLSR) in terms of accuracy, bias, and robustness. Most robust results along gradients of training/validation partitioning and noise variance were obtained by KRR while GPR delivered most accurate estimations. We applied a GPR model to a hyperspectral HyMap flightline to map LCC and LAI.

Data from 18 participants were used to train an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

We built three classification models with training data of 76,936 posts from two large online forums and applied the models to classify messages into statistics-related and non-statistics-related posts in a private Facebook group. Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades.

Objective This study aims to report a quality improvement effort to integrate a deep learning sepsis detection and management platform, Sepsis Watch, into routine clinical care. Methods In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Results Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Conclusions Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare.

While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs.

In these approaches, first-principle prioritization criteria are replaced by a pairwise preference elicitation process. Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called case-based ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approximation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem. The results prove that on average our approach outperforms AHP with respect to the trade-off between expert elicitation effort and the requirement prioritization accuracy.",2005,30,86,2,False,Computer Science,1744234,P.

When data is scarce, knowledge can be farmed from seeds; i.e. minimal and partial descriptions of a domain. These seeds can be grown into large datasets via Monte Carlo simulations. The datasets can then be harvested using machine learning techniques. Examples of this knowledge farming approach, and the associated technique of data-mining, is given from numerous software engineering domains. Machine learning (ML) is not hard. Machine learners automatically generate summaries of data or existing systems in a smaller form. Software engineers can use machine learners to simplify systems development. This chapter explains how to use ML to assist in the construction of systems that support classification, prediction, diagnosis, planning, monitoring, requirements engineering, validation, and maintenance. This chapter approaches machine learning with three specific biases. First, we will explore machine learning in data-starved domains. Machine learning is typically proposed for domains that contain large datasets. Our experience strongly suggests that many domains lack such large datasets. This lack of data is particularly acute for newer, smaller software companies. Such companies lack the resources to collect and maintain such data. Also, they have not been developing products long enough to collect an appropriately large dataset. When we cannot mine data, we show how to farm knowledge by growing datasets from domain models. Second, we will only report mature machine learning methods; i.e. those methods which do not require highly specialized skills to execute. This second bias rules out some of the more exciting work on the leading edge of machine learning research (e.g. horn-clause learning). Third, in the author’s view, it has yet to be shown empirically from realistic examples that a particular learning technique is necessarily better than the others . When faced with arguably equivalent techniques, Occam’s razor suggests we use the simplest. We hence will explore simple decision tree learners in this chapter. Decision tree learners execute very quickly and are widely used: many of the practical SE applications of machine learning use decision tree learners like C4.5 [33] or the CART For evidence of this statement, see the comparisons of different learning methods in [34, 17, 36]",2000,15,37,1,False,Computer Science,1703872,T.

Assistive technology and health informatics are fields for which minor improvements achieved through leveraging more advanced machine learning algorithms can translate to major real world impact. However, successful application of machine learning currently requires broad domain knowledge to determine which model is appropriate for a given task, and model specific expertise to configure a model to a problem of interest. A major motivation for this thesis was: How can we make machine learning more accessible to assistive technology and health informatics researchers? Naturally, a complementary goal is to make machine learning more accessible in general. Specifically, in this thesis we explore how to automate the role of a machine learning expert through automatically adapting models and adjusting parameters to a given task of interest. This thesis consists of a number of contributions towards solving this challenging open problem in machine learning and these are empirically validated on four real-world applications. Through an interesting theoretical link between two seemingly disparate latent variable models, we create a hybrid model that allows one to flexibly interpolate over a parametric unsupervised neural network, a classification neural network and a non-parametric Gaussian process. We demonstrate empirically that this non-parametrically guided autoencoder allows one to learn a latent representation that is more useful for a given task of interest.",2014,158,45,7,False,Computer Science,144108062,Jasper Snoek,,,Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smartphones can measure PD features, yet no smartphone-derived rating score exists to assess motor symptom severity in real-world settings. Objectives To develop an objective measure of PD severity and test construct validity by evaluating the ability of the measure to capture intraday symptom fluctuations, correlate with current standard PD outcome measures, and respond to dopaminergic therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational study assessed individuals with PD who remotely completed 5 tasks (voice, finger tapping, gait, balance, and reaction time) on the smartphone application. We used a novel machine-learning–based approach to generate a mobile Parkinson disease score (mPDS) that objectively weighs features derived from each smartphone activity (eg, stride length from the gait activity) and is scaled from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater severity). Individuals with and without PD additionally completed standard in-person assessments of PD with smartphone assessments during a period of 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures Ability of the mPDS to detect intraday symptom fluctuations, the correlation between the mPDS and standard measures, and the ability of the mPDS to respond to dopaminergic medication. Results The mPDS was derived from 6148 smartphone activity assessments from 129 individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.6] years; 56 [43.4%] women). Gait features contributed most to the total mPDS (33.4%). In addition, 23 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [11.5] years; 11 [48%] women) and 17 without PD (mean [SD] age 54.2 [16.5] years; 12 [71%] women) completed in-clinic assessments. The mPDS detected symptom fluctuations with a mean (SD) intraday change of 13.9 (10.3) points on a scale of 0 to 100. The measure correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease’s Rating Scale total (r = 0.81; P < .001) and part III only (r = 0.88; P < .001), the Timed Up and Go assessment (r = 0.72; P = .002), and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r = 0.91; P < .001). The mPDS improved by a mean (SD) of 16.3 (5.6) points in response to dopaminergic therapy. Conclusions and Relevance Using a novel machine-learning approach, we created and demonstrated construct validity of an objective PD severity score derived from smartphone assessments. This score complements standard PD measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world assessments that could enhance clinical care and evaluation of novel therapeutics.",2018,22,230,6,False,Medicine,1778154,A.

This class, which we refer to as the ""Adam-type"", includes the popular algorithms such as the Adam, AMSGrad and AdaGrad. Despite their popularity in training deep neural networks, the convergence of these algorithms for solving nonconvex problems remains an open question. This paper provides a set of mild sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence for the Adam-type methods. We prove that under our derived conditions, these methods can achieve the convergence rate of order $O(\log{T}/\sqrt{T})$ for nonconvex stochastic optimization. We show the conditions are essential in the sense that violating them may make the algorithm diverge. Moreover, we propose and analyze a class of (deterministic) incremental adaptive gradient algorithms, which has the same $O(\log{T}/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate.

In the past decades, the machine learning problem has evolved from conventional single-view learning problem, to cross-view learning, cross-domain learning and multitask learning, where a large number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Despite having large number of action recognition datasets, most of them are designed for a subset of the four learning problems, where the comparisons between algorithms can further limited by variances within datasets, experimental configurations, and other factors.

In order to estimate sea ice thickness from satellite altimeter data, leads (i.e., cracks between ice floes) should first be identified for the calculation of sea ice freeboard. In this study, we proposed novel approaches for lead detection using two machine learning algorithms: decision trees and random forest. CryoSat-2 satellite data collected in March and April of 2011–2014 over the Arctic region were used to extract waveform parameters that show the characteristics of leads, ice floes and ocean, including stack standard deviation, stack skewness, stack kurtosis, pulse peakiness and backscatter sigma-0. The parameters were used to identify leads in the machine learning models. Results show that the proposed approaches, with overall accuracy >90%, produced much better performance than existing lead detection methods based on simple thresholding approaches. Sea ice thickness estimated based on the machine learning-detected leads was compared to the averaged Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM)-bird data collected over two days during the CryoSat Validation experiment (CryoVex) field campaign in April 2011. This comparison showed that the proposed machine learning methods had better performance (up to r = 0.83 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.29 m) compared to thickness estimation based on existing lead detection methods (RMSE = 0.86–0.93 m).

Recently, multi-armed bandits have drawn intensive attention in various machine learning applications in online settings. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation to maximize rewards in bandit algorithms naturally establishes a connection to portfolio choice problems. In this paper, we present a bandit algorithm for conducting online portfolio choices by effectually exploiting correlations among multiple arms. Through constructing orthogonal portfolios from multiple assets and integrating with the upper confidence bound bandit framework, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy that represents the combination of passive and active investments according to a risk-adjusted reward function.

Previously, we found that users were willing to provide a generous amount of rich feedback to machine learning systems, and that the types of some of this rich feedback seem promising for assimilation by machine learning algorithms. Following up on those findings, we ran an experiment to assess the viability of incorporating real-time keyword-based feedback in initial training phases when data is limited. We found that rich feedback improved accuracy but an initial unstable period often caused large fluctuations in classifier behavior. Participants were able to give feedback by relying heavily on system communication in order to respond to changes. The results show that in order to benefit from the user's knowledge, machine learning systems must be able to absorb keyword-based rich feedback in a graceful manner and provide clear explanations of their predictions.",2008,31,53,2,True,Computer Science,2121662,S.

In response, computer scientists have developed myriad definitions of fairness to correct this bias in fielded algorithms. While some definitions are based on established legal and ethical norms, others are largely mathematical. It is unclear whether the general public agrees with these fairness definitions, and perhaps more importantly, whether they understand these definitions. We take initial steps toward bridging this gap between ML researchers and the public, by addressing the question: does a lay audience understand a basic definition of ML fairness? We develop a metric to measure comprehension of three such definitions--demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. We evaluate this metric using an online survey, and investigate the relationship between comprehension and sentiment, demographics, and the definition itself.",2019,47,31,1,False,Computer Science,6972492,Debjani Saha,29326342.0,Candice Schumann,Psychology,,9561277.0,Duncan C.

Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.",2020,63,88,6,True,Medicine,16015502,D.

Commonly, this is achieved via the violation of Bell inequalities. Unfortunately, however, their systematic derivation quickly becomes unfeasible as the scenario of interest grows in complexity. To cope with that, here, we propose a machine learning approach for the detection and quantification of nonlocality. It consists of an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons blended with genetic algorithms achieving a high performance in a number of relevant Bell scenarios. As we show, not only can the machine learn to quantify nonlocality, but discover new kinds of nonlocal correlations inaccessible with other current methods as well.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization.

The price to pay for using expensive methods is that they do not scale well, and this is reflected in the small-scale experiments.

Moreover, to generate more humanfriendly explanations, recent work on interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as ""Why does this model makes such decisions?"" or ""Was it a specific feature that caused the decision made by the model?"".

Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data.

ML is being used at every stage of biosystems design to help find non-obvious engineering solutions with fewer design iterations. In this review, we first describe commonly used models and modeling paradigms within ML. We then discuss some applications of these models that have already shown success in biotechnological applications. Moreover, we discuss successful applications at all scales of biosystems design, including nucleic acids, genetic circuits, proteins, pathways, genomes, and bioprocess. Finally, we discuss some limitations of these methods and potential solutions as well as prospects of the combination of ML and biosystems design.",2020,147,41,2,False,Computer Science,2058971869,M.

Previous methods for EE typically model it as a classification task, which are usually prone to the data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a new learning paradigm of EE, by explicitly casting it as a machine reading comprehension problem (MRC). Our approach includes an unsupervised question generation process, which can transfer event schema into a set of natural questions, followed by a BERT-based question-answering process to retrieve answers as EE results. This learning paradigm enables us to strengthen the reasoning process of EE, by introducing sophisticated models in MRC, and relieve the data scarcity problem, by introducing the large-scale datasets in MRC. The empirical results show that: i) our approach attains state-of-the-art performance by considerable margins over previous methods. ii) Our model is excelled in the data-scarce scenario, for example, obtaining 49.8\% in F1 for event argument extraction with only 1\% data, compared with 2.2\% of the previous method. iii) Our model also fits with zero-shot scenarios, achieving $37.0\%$ and $16\%$ in F1 on two datasets without using any EE training data.",2020,42,119,23,True,Computer Science,2150168776,Jian Liu,152829071.0,Yubo Chen,,,77397868.0,Kang Liu,1844673750.0,Wei Bi,3028405.0,Xiaojiang Liu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations.

Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array.

While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing---synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone. We applied our methodology using the Open Directory Project, the largest existing Web directory built by over 70,000 human editors.

In the context of condensed matter physics, most progress in the field of supervised learning has come from employing neural networks as classifiers. Although very powerful, such algorithms suffer from a lack of interpretability, which is usually desired in scientific applications in order to associate learned features with physical phenomena. In this paper, we explore support vector machines (SVMs), which are a class of supervised kernel methods that provide interpretable decision functions. We find that SVMs can learn the mathematical form of physical discriminators, such as order parameters and Hamiltonian constraints, for a set of two-dimensional spin models: the ferromagnetic Ising model, a conserved-order-parameter Ising model, and the Ising gauge theory.

Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\it instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100. Although assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to outperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an instance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that of CD-100 for the case studied here.",2015,27,153,10,True,Physics,3468759,M.

This paper extends the work in counterfactual explanations by addressing the challenge of feasibility of such examples. For explanations of ML models in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, counterfactual examples are useful for an end-user only to the extent that perturbation of feature inputs is feasible in the real world. We formulate the problem of feasibility as preserving causal relationships among input features and present a method that uses (partial) structural causal models to generate actionable counterfactuals. When feasibility constraints cannot be easily expressed, we consider an alternative mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output. Our experiments on Bayesian networks and the widely used ''Adult-Income'' dataset show that our proposed methods can generate counterfactual explanations that better satisfy feasibility constraints than existing methods..
