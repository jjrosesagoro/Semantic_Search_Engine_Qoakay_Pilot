These technologies allow multiple independent virtual machines to reside in apparent isolation on the same physical host. Dynamically scaling applications running on IaaS clouds can lead to varied and unpredictable results because of the performance interference effects associated with co‐located virtual machines. Determining appropriate scaling policies in a dynamic non‐stationary environment is non‐trivial. One principle advantage exhibited by IaaS clouds over their traditional hosting counterparts is the ability to scale resources on‐demand. However, a problem arises concerning resource allocation as to which resources should be added and removed when the underlying performance of the resource is in a constant state of flux. Decision theoretic frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes are particularly suited to decision making under uncertainty. By applying a temporal difference, reinforcement learning algorithm known as Q‐learning, optimal scaling policies can be determined. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques typically suffer from curse of dimensionality problems, where the state space grows exponentially with each additional state variable. To address this challenge, we also present a novel parallel Q‐learning approach aimed at reducing the time taken to determine optimal policies whilst learning online.

Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model's ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project.

On the other hand, deep learning can extract and organize the discriminative information from the data, not requiring the design of feature extractors by a domain expert. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a particular type of deep, feedforward network that have gained attention from research community and industry, achieving empirical successes in tasks such as speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing and transfer learning. In this paper, we conduct some preliminary experiments using the deep learning approach to classify breast cancer histopathological images from BreaKHis, a publicly dataset available at http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. We propose a method based on the extraction of image patches for training the CNN and the combination of these patches for final classification. This method aims to allow using the high-resolution histopathological images from BreaKHis as input to existing CNN, avoiding adaptations of the model that can lead to a more complex and computationally costly architecture. The CNN performance is better when compared to previously reported results obtained by other machine learning models trained with hand-crafted textural descriptors. Finally, we also investigate the combination of different CNNs using simple fusion rules, achieving some improvement in recognition rates.",2016,33,559,41,False,Computer Science,32786132,F.

Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it difficult to identify the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to over 50 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than $10\%$, identifying several broken defenses.",2020,58,653,225,False,Computer Science,39171784,Francesco Croce,143610806.0,Matthias Hein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.",2017,51,469,107,False,Computer Science,2119734444,Neeraj Kumar,3200813.0,R.

Side-channel analysis is now used in practice in design companies as well as in test laboratories, and the security of products against side-channel attacks has significantly improved. However, there are still some remaining issues to be solved for side-channel analysis to become more effective. Side-channel analysis consists of two steps, commonly referred to as identification and exploitation. The identification consists of understanding the leakage and building suitable models. The exploitation consists of using the identified leakage models to extract the secret key. In scenarios where the model is poorly known, it can be approximated in a profiling phase. There, machine learning techniques are gaining value. In this paper, we conduct extensive analysis of several machine learning techniques, showing the importance of proper parameter tuning and training. In contrast to what is perceived as common knowledge in unrestricted scenarios, we show that some machine learning techniques can significantly outperform template attacks when properly used. We therefore stress that the traditional worst case security assessment of cryptographic implementations, that mainly includes template attacks, might not be accurate enough. Besides that, we present a new measure called the Data Confusion Factor that can be used to assess how well machine learning techniques will perform on a certain dataset.",2017,26,83,3,False,Computer Science,1686538,S.

In most of the current training schemes the central model is refined by averaging the parameters of the server model and the updated parameters from the client side. However, directly averaging model parameters is only possible if all models have the same structure and size, which could be a restrictive constraint in many scenarios. In this work we investigate more powerful and more flexible aggregation schemes for FL. Specifically, we propose ensemble distillation for model fusion, i.e. training the central classifier through unlabeled data on the outputs of the models from the clients. This knowledge distillation technique mitigates privacy risk and cost to the same extent as the baseline FL algorithms, but allows flexible aggregation over heterogeneous client models that can differ e.g. in size, numerical precision or structure. We show in extensive empirical experiments on various CV/NLP datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, AG News, SST2) and settings (heterogeneous models/data) that the server model can be trained much faster, requiring fewer communication rounds than any existing FL technique so far.",2020,86,250,52,False,Computer Science,145724662,Tao Lin,2069275317.0,Lingjing Kong,2127057.0,Sebastian U.

The architecture described here makes use of a new algorithm for SVM learning which is less sensitive to quantization errors respect to the solution appeared so far in the literature.

Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closedform mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to introduce a random forests (RFs)-based prognostic method for tool wear prediction as well as compare the performance of RFs with feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) ANNs and SVR. Specifically, the performance of FFBP ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental data collected from 315 milling tests. Experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than FFBP ANNs with a single hidden layer and SVR.

We present Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support interpretation, debugging, and comparison of machine learning models in a more transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination.

Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms—deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers’ load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume.

Recently, ASD has been studied in the behavioural sciences using intelligent methods based around machine learning to speed up the screening time or to improve sensitivity, specificity or accuracy of the diagnosis process. Machine learning considers the ASD diagnosis problem as a classification task in which predictive models are built based on historical cases and controls. These models are supposed to be plugged into a screening tool to accomplish one or more of the aforementioned goals. In this paper, we shed light on recent studies that employ machine learning in ASD classification in order to discuss their pros and cons. Moreover, we highlight a noticeable problem associated with current ASD screening tools; the reliability of these tools using the DSM-IV rather than the DSM-5 manual.

To utilize the precious labeling effort effectively, active learning queries the user with selective sampling in an interactive way. Traditional active learning techniques merely focus on the unlabeled data set under a unidirectional exploration framework and suffer from model deterioration in the presence of noise. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel bidirectional active learning algorithm that explores into both unlabeled and labeled data sets simultaneously in a two-way process. For the acquisition of new knowledge, forward learning queries the most informative instances from unlabeled data set. For the introspection of learned knowledge, backward learning detects the most suspiciously unreliable instances within the labeled data set. Under the two-way exploration framework, the generalization ability of the learning model can be greatly improved, which is demonstrated by the encouraging experimental results.",2015,53,68,6,False,Computer Science,120069940,Xiaoyu Zhang,1788327.0,Shupeng Wang,2067242918.0,Xiao-chun Yun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anomaly detection task is to recognize the presence of an unusual and potentially hazardous state within the activities of a computer user, system, or network. “Unusual” is defined with respect to some model of “normal” behavior which may be either hard-coded or learned from observation. We focus here on learning models of normalcy at the user behavioral level, as observed through command line data. An anomaly detection agent faces many learning problems including learning from streams of temporal data, learning from instances of a single class, and adaptation to a dynamically changing concept. We describe two approaches to the construction of such models: one that employs instance-based models of user behaviors and one that uses hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the performance of sensors based on these models under a wide range of parameter settings and show conditions under which maximal classification performance is achieved. Using provided labels of users' job descriptions, we demonstrate that users can be roughly divided into behavioral classes related to their experience level. Finally, we study methods for adapting user models to changing behavioral patterns and show the methods' performance strengths and weaknesses.",2000,2,136,6,False,Computer Science,143673956,T.

Scoring functions (SFs) are employed to rank these molecules by their predicted binding affinity (potency). A classical SF assumes a predetermined theory‐inspired functional form for the relationship between the features characterizing the structure of the protein–ligand complex and its predicted binding affinity (this relationship is almost always assumed to be linear). Recent years have seen the prosperity of machine‐learning SFs, which are fast regression models built instead with contemporary supervised learning algorithms. In this review, we analyzed machine‐learning SFs for drug lead optimization in the 2015–2019 period. The performance gap between classical and machine‐learning SFs was large and has now broadened owing to methodological improvements and the availability of more training data. Against the expectations of many experts, SFs employing deep learning techniques were not always more predictive than those based on more established machine learning techniques and, when they were, the performance gain was small. More codes and webservers are available and ready to be applied to prospective structure‐based drug lead optimization studies.

However, validated algorithms for predicting activity type from wrist-worn accelerometer data are lacking. This study compared the activity recognition rates of an activity classifier trained on acceleration signal collected on the wrist and hip. Methodology: 52 children and adolescents (mean age 13.7  ±  3.1 year) completed 12 activity trials that were categorized into 7 activity classes: lying down, sitting, standing, walking, running, basketball, and dancing. During each trial, participants wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ tri-axial accelerometer on the right hip and the non-dominant wrist. Features were extracted from 10-s windows and inputted into a regularized logistic regression model using R (Glmnet + L1). Results: Classification accuracy for the hip and wrist was 91.0% ± 3.1% and 88.4% ± 3.0%, respectively.

The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a “configurator.” Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provides significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or “bad” priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels).

A widely adopted approach to this objective is to apply various machine learning algorithms to compute descriptive models of the available data.

Distributed systems may need to deal with heterogenous platforms, with multiple databases and (possibly) different schemas, with the design and implementation of scalable and effective protocols for communicating among the data sites, and the selective and efficient use of the information that is gathered from other peer data sites.

However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants are most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. In extreme cases, this can also lead to long-term conditions, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning difficulties, including poor health and growth. In the US alone, the societal and economic cost of preterm births, in 2005, was estimated to be $26.2 billion, per annum. In the UK, this value was close to £2.95 billion, in 2009. Many believe that a better understanding of why preterm births occur, and a strategic focus on prevention, will help to improve the health of children and reduce healthcare costs. At present, most methods of preterm birth prediction are subjective. However, a strong body of evidence suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals (Electrohysterography), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and predict preterm deliveries. Most Electrohysterography studies focus on true labour detection during the final seven days, before labour. The challenge is to utilise Electrohysterography techniques to predict preterm delivery earlier in the pregnancy. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies term and preterm records, using an open source dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to oversample the minority preterm class, and cross validation techniques, are used to evaluate the dataset against other similar studies.

The ranking problem aims to induce an ordering or preference relations among a set of instances in the input space. However, collecting labeled data is growing into a burden in many rank applications since labeling requires eliciting the relative ordering over the set of alternatives. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning framework for SVM-based and boosting-based rank learning. Our approach suggests sampling based on maximizing the estimated loss differential over unlabeled data. Experimental results on two benchmark corpora show that the proposed model substantially reduces the labeling effort, and achieves superior performance rapidly with as much as 30% relative improvement over the margin-based sampling baseline.",2008,22,70,8,True,Mathematics,2046500,Pinar Donmez,143712374.0,J.

However, in the financial domain expert-based credit risk models have still been dominating. Establishing meaningful benchmark and comparisons on machine-learning approaches and human expert-based models is a prerequisite in further introducing novel methods. Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based model—FICO credit scoring system—by using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. As the SCF data is non-synthetic and consists of a large number of real variables, we applied two variable-selection methods: the first method used hypothesis tests, correlation and random forest-based feature importance measures and the second method was only a random forest-based new approach (NAP), to select the best representative features for effective modelling and to compare them. We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable. In addition, the deep neural networks and XGBoost algorithms trained on the subset selected by NAP achieve the highest area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy, respectively.",2019,91,59,2,True,Economics,41070543,Lkhagvadorj Munkhdalai,2227827.0,Tsendsuren Munkhdalai,2710822.0,Oyun-Erdene Namsrai,2108614875.0,Jong Yun Lee,3080120.0,K.

The main research in this area relates to the design choices for feature representation and for effective decompositions of the task in different learning models. Regarding the former choice, structural properties of full syntactic parses are largely employed as they represent ways to encode different principles suggested by the linking theory between syntax and semantics. The latter choice relates to several learning schemes over global views of the parses. For example, re-ranking stages operating over alternative predicate-argument sequences of the same sentence have shown to be very effective. In this article, we propose several kernel functions to model parse tree properties in kernel-based machines, for example, perceptrons or support vector machines. In particular, we define different kinds of tree kernels as general approaches to feature engineering in SRL. Moreover, we extensively experiment with such kernels to investigate their contribution to individual stages of an SRL architecture both in isolation and in combination with other traditional manually coded features. The results for boundary recognition, classification, and re-ranking stages provide systematic evidence about the significant impact of tree kernels on the overall accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is small. As a conclusive result, tree kernels allow for a general and easily portable feature engineering method which is applicable to a large family of natural language processing tasks.",2008,46,175,5,True,Computer Science,1719404,Alessandro Moschitti,2726534.0,Daniele Pighin,144654543.0,Roberto Basili,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The covering numbers of the class are then determined via the entropy numbers of the operator.

With the recent cataloging of thousands of acetylation sites on hundreds of proteins comes the challenge of identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that regulate acetylation levels. Sirtuins are a conserved family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. SIRT3 is the dominant protein deacetylase in mitochondria, and emerging evidence suggests that SIRT3 may control major pathways by deacetylation of central metabolic enzymes. Here, to identify potential SIRT3 substrates, we have developed an unbiased screening strategy that involves a novel acetyl-lysine analogue (thiotrifluoroacetyl-lysine), SPOT-peptide libraries, machine learning, and kinetic validation. SPOT peptide libraries based on known and potential mitochondrial acetyl-lysine sites were screened for SIRT3 binding and then analyzed using machine learning to establish binding trends. These trends were then applied to the mitochondrial proteome as a whole to predict binding affinity of all lysine sites within human mitochondria. Machine learning prediction of SIRT3 binding correlated with steady-state kinetic k(cat)/K(m) values for 24 acetyl-lysine peptides that possessed a broad range of predicted binding. Thus, SPOT peptide-binding screens and machine learning prediction provides an accurate and efficient method to evaluate sirtuin substrate specificity from a relatively small learning set. These analyses suggest potential SIRT3 substrates involved in several metabolic pathways such as the urea cycle, ATP synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation.",2011,116,70,7,True,Biology,38164159,Brian C.

SNNs on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between SNNs and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages.

However, their strength is also their main weakness, as the generated nonlinear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. In this paper, we propose a new active learning-based approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules. This performance increase, both in terms of predictive accuracy as comprehensibility, is confirmed in our experiments where we apply ALBA on several publicly available data sets.",2009,56,148,9,False,Computer Science,145147309,David Martens,1720683.0,B.

HBP can also selectively and non-covalently interact with hormone. Therefore, accurate identification of HBP is an important prerequisite for understanding its biological functions and molecular mechanisms. Since experimental methods are still labor intensive and cost ineffective to identify HBP, it's necessary to develop computational methods to accurately and efficiently identify HBP. In this paper, a machine learning-based method was proposed to identify HBP, in which the samples were encoded by using the optimal tripeptide composition obtained based on the binomial distribution method. In the 5-fold cross-validation test, the proposed method yielded an overall accuracy of 97.15%.

The availability of an automated computer analysis tool that is more objective than human readers can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. A computer‐assisted classification method combining conventional MRI and perfusion MRI is developed and used for differential diagnosis. The proposed scheme consists of several steps including region‐of‐interest definition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The extracted features include tumor shape and intensity characteristics, as well as rotation invariant texture features. Feature subset selection is performed using support vector machines with recursive feature elimination. The method was applied on a population of 102 brain tumors histologically diagnosed as metastasis ( 24 ), meningiomas ( 4 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade II ( 22 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade III ( 18 ), and glioblastomas ( 34 ). The binary support vector machine classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, assessed by leave‐one‐out cross‐validation, were, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 79% for discrimination of metastases from gliomas and 88%, 85%, and 96% for discrimination of high‐grade (grades III and IV) from low‐grade (grade II) neoplasms. Multiclass classification was also performed via a one‐vs‐all voting scheme. Magn Reson Med, 2009. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",2009,48,630,34,True,Computer Science,1784303,E.
