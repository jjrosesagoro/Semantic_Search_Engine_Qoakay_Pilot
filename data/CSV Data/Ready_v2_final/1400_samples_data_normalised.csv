To establish tractable and scalable objectives, recent work has turned to variational bounds parameterized by neural networks, but the relationships and tradeoffs between these bounds remains unclear. In this work, we unify these recent developments in a single framework. We find that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large, exhibiting either high bias or high variance. To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly trades off bias and variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically characterize the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new bounds for estimation and representation learning.",2019,53,423,69,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,16443937,Ben Poole,1955694.0,Sherjil Ozair,3422336.0,AÃ¤ron van den Oord,122113652.0,Alexander A.

However, these structural differences appear subtle in comparison with conventional radiologically defined abnormalities, with considerable inter-subject variability. Consequently, it has not been possible to readily identify scans from patients with major depressive disorder at an individual level. Recently, machine learning techniques such as relevance vector machines and support vector machines have been applied to predictive classification of individual scans with variable success. Here we describe a novel hybrid method, which combines machine learning with feature selection and characterization, with the latter aimed at maximizing the accuracy of machine learning prediction. The method was tested using a multi-centre dataset of T(1)-weighted 'structural' scans. A total of 62 patients with major depressive disorder and matched controls were recruited from referred secondary care clinical populations in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, UK. The generalization ability and predictive accuracy of the classifiers was tested using data left out of the training process. High prediction accuracy was achieved (~90%). While feature selection was important for maximizing high predictive accuracy with machine learning, feature characterization contributed only a modest improvement to relevance vector machine-based prediction (~5%). Notably, while the only information provided for training the classifiers was T(1)-weighted scans plus a categorical label (major depressive disorder versus controls), both relevance vector machine and support vector machine 'weighting factors' (used for making predictions) correlated strongly with subjective ratings of illness severity. These results indicate that machine learning techniques have the potential to inform clinical practice and research, as they can make accurate predictions about brain scan data from individual subjects. Furthermore, machine learning weighting factors may reflect an objective biomarker of major depressive disorder illness severity, based on abnormalities of brain structure.",2012,60,171,8,True,Medicine,Psychology,145321317,B.

High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.",2019,31,387,7,True,Medicine,Computer Science,8452323,A.

We sought to overcome these limitations by applying machine learning to electronic health records within a large medical database. Participants were 5,167 adult patients with a claim code for self-injury (i.e., ICD-9, E95x); expert review of records determined that 3,250 patients made a suicide attempt (i.e., cases), and 1,917 patients engaged in self-injury that was nonsuicidal, accidental, or nonverifiable (i.e., controls). We developed machine learning algorithms that accurately predicted future suicide attempts (AUC = 0.84, precision = 0.79, recall = 0.95, Brier score = 0.14). Moreover, accuracy improved from 720 days to 7 days before the suicide attempt, and predictor importance shifted across time.

An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals.

However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs several iterations before converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation. Weights on each kernel matrix are included in the standard SVM empirical risk minimization problem with a l1 constraint to encourage sparsity.

Bergen et al. review how these methods can be applied to solid Earth datasets. Adopting machine-learning techniques is important for extracting information and for understanding the increasing amount of complex data collected in the geosciences. Science, this issue p. eaau0323 BACKGROUND The solid Earth, oceans, and atmosphere together form a complex interacting geosystem. Processes relevant to understanding Earthâs geosystem behavior range in spatial scale from the atomic to the planetary, and in temporal scale from milliseconds to billions of years. Physical, chemical, and biological processes interact and have substantial influence on this complex geosystem, and humans interact with it in ways that are increasingly consequential to the future of both the natural world and civilization as the finiteness of Earth becomes increasingly apparent and limits on available energy, mineral resources, and fresh water increasingly affect the human condition. Earth is subject to a variety of geohazards that are poorly understood, yet increasingly impactful as our exposure grows through increasing urbanization, particularly in hazard-prone areas. We have a fundamental need to develop the best possible predictive understanding of how the geosystem works, and that understanding must be informed by both the present and the deep past. This understanding will come through the analysis of increasingly large geo-datasets and from computationally intensive simulations, often connected through inverse problems. Geoscientists are faced with the challenge of extracting as much useful information as possible and gaining new insights from these data, simulations, and the interplay between the two. Techniques from the rapidly evolving field of machine learning (ML) will play a key role in this effort. ADVANCES The confluence of ultrafast computers with large memory, rapid progress in ML algorithms, and the ready availability of large datasets place geoscience at the threshold of dramatic progress. We anticipate that this progress will come from the application of ML across three categories of research effort: (i) automation to perform a complex prediction task that cannot easily be described by a set of explicit commands; (ii) modeling and inverse problems to create a representation that approximates numerical simulations or captures relationships; and (iii) discovery to reveal new and often unanticipated patterns, structures, or relationships. Examples of automation include geologic mapping using remote-sensing data, characterizing the topology of fracture systems to model subsurface transport, and classifying volcanic ash particles to infer eruptive mechanism. Examples of modeling include approximating the viscoelastic response for complex rheology, determining wave speed models directly from tomographic data, and classifying diverse seismic events. Examples of discovery include predicting laboratory slip events using observations of acoustic emissions, detecting weak earthquake signals using similarity search, and determining the connectivity of subsurface reservoirs using groundwater tracer observations. OUTLOOK The use of ML in solid Earth geosciences is growing rapidly, but is still in its early stages and making uneven progress. Much remains to be done with existing datasets from long-standing data sources, which in many cases are largely unexplored. Newer, unconventional data sources such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fiber-optic sensing, and crowd-sourced measurements may demand new approaches through both the volume and the character of information that they present. Practical steps could accelerate and broaden the use of ML in the geosciences. Wider adoption of open-science principles such as open source code, open data, and open access will better position the solid Earth community to take advantage of rapid developments in ML and artificial intelligence. Benchmark datasets and challenge problems have played an important role in driving progress in artificial intelligence research by enabling rigorous performance comparison and could play a similar role in the geosciences. Testing on high-quality datasets produces better models, and benchmark datasets make these data widely available to the research community. They also help recruit expertise from allied disciplines. Close collaboration between geoscientists and ML researchers will aid in making quick progress in ML geoscience applications. Extracting maximum value from geoscientific data will require new approaches for combining data-driven methods, physical modeling, and algorithms capable of learning with limited, weak, or biased labels. Funding opportunities that target the intersection of these disciplines, as well as a greater component of data science and ML education in the geosciences, could help bring this effort to fruition.

As a step toward a solution, we introduce a novel â1-vs-set machine,â which sculpts a decision space from the marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear kernel.

Also we show an algorithm to calculate 1 and m1 based on the resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry. In regular statistical models, 21 is equal to the number of parameters and m1 = 1, whereas in nonregular models, such as multilayer networks, 21 is not larger than the number of parameters and m1 1.

The tool of choice for the machine learning seems to be the support vector machine (SVM). In this paper, we propose an alternative and well-known machine learning tool-ensemble classifiers implemented as random forests-and argue that they are ideally suited for steganalysis. Ensemble classifiers scale much more favorably w.r.t. the number of training examples and the feature dimensionality with performance comparable to the much more complex SVMs. The significantly lower training complexity opens up the possibility for the steganalyst to work with rich (high-dimensional) cover models and train on larger training sets-two key elements that appear necessary to reliably detect modern steganographic algorithms. Ensemble classification is portrayed here as a powerful developer tool that allows fast construction of steganography detectors with markedly improved detection accuracy across a wide range of embedding methods.

This paper presents a novel framework, called Riemannian manifold learning (RML), based on the assumption that the input high-dimensional data lie on an intrinsically low-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The main idea is to formulate the dimensionality reduction problem as a classical problem in Riemannian geometry, that is, how to construct coordinate charts for a given Riemannian manifold? We implement the Riemannian normal coordinate chart, which has been the most widely used in Riemannian geometry, for a set of unorganized data points. First, two input parameters (the neighborhood size k and the intrinsic dimension d) are estimated based on an efficient simplicial reconstruction of the underlying manifold. Then, the normal coordinates are computed to map the input high-dimensional data into a low- dimensional space. Experiments on synthetic data, as well as real-world images, demonstrate that our algorithm can learn intrinsic geometric structures of the data, preserve radial geodesic distances, and yield regular embeddings.",2008,58,380,17,False,Mathematics,Medicine,2109626482,Tong Lin,1687248.0,H.

Recently, a simple and efficient learning method, referred to as extreme learning machine (ELM), was proposed by Huang , which has shown that, compared to some conventional methods, the training time of neural networks can be reduced by a thousand times. However, one of the open problems in ELM research is whether the number of hidden nodes can be further reduced without affecting learning effectiveness. This brief proposes a new learning algorithm, called bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM), in which some hidden nodes are not randomly selected. In theory, this algorithm tends to reduce network output error to 0 at an extremely early learning stage. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the network output error and the network output weights in the proposed B-ELM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can be tens to hundreds of times faster than other incremental ELM algorithms.",2012,14,162,6,False,Computer Science,Medicine,2108776795,Yimin Yang,2119048509.0,Yaonan Wang,2474758.0,Xiaofang Yuan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motivated by the usefulness of tensor networks for machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum computing approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based on tree and matrix product state tensor networks, that could already have benefits with such near-term devices. The result is a unified framework in which classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware today, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.",2018,72,189,13,True,Physics,Computer Science,145287043,W.

In addition, we construct target-specific saliency map by backprojecting CNN features with guidance of the SVM, and obtain the final tracking result in each frame based on the appearance model generatively constructed with the saliency map. Since the saliency map reveals spatial configuration of target effectively, it improves target localization accuracy and enables us to achieve pixel-level target segmentation.

The machine learning algorithms studied included multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via Bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.",2002,99,188,5,False,Computer Science,Medicine,9261843,K.

One challenge with integrating renewables into the grid is that their power generation is intermittent and uncontrollable. Thus, predicting future renewable generation is important, since the grid must dispatch generators to satisfy demand as generation varies. While manually developing sophisticated prediction models may be feasible for large-scale solar farms, developing them for distributed generation at millions of homes throughout the grid is a challenging problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we explore automatically creating site-specific prediction models for solar power generation from National Weather Service (NWS) weather forecasts using machine learning techniques. We compare multiple regression techniques for generating prediction models, including linear least squares and support vector machines using multiple kernel functions. We evaluate the accuracy of each model using historical NWS forecasts and solar intensity readings from a weather station deployment for nearly a year.

We claim that the problem of dialog design can be formalized as an optimization problem with an objective function reflecting different dialog dimensions relevant for a given application. We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups.",2000,36,588,45,False,Computer Science,,8992604,E.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging.

Execution is fully reactive in the sense that no planning intervenes between perception and action. Dyna relies on machine learning methods for learning from examples---these are among the basic building blocks making up the architecture---yet is not tied to any particular method. This paper briefly introduces Dyna and discusses its strengths and weaknesses with respect to other architectures.",1990,29,721,64,True,Computer Science,,1699645,R.

This sharply deviates from traditional machine learning and necessitates the design of algorithms robust to various sources of heterogeneity. Specifically, statistical heterogeneity of data across user devices can severely degrade the performance of standard federated averaging for traditional machine learning applications like personalization with deep learning.

However, relatively little is known about their theoretical properties, especially in the setting of lifelong learning, where the goal is to transfer information to tasks for which no data have been observed so far. In this work we study lifelong learning from a theoretical perspective. Our main result is a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that offers a unified view on existing paradigms for transfer learning, such as the transfer of parameters or the transfer of low-dimensional representations. We also use the bound to derive two principled lifelong learning algorithms, and we show that these yield results comparable with existing methods.",2013,31,171,19,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,2989149,Anastasia Pentina,1787591.0,Christoph H.

It provides a unified solution that can be used directly to solve regression, binary, and multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a stacked ELMs (S-ELMs) that is specially designed for solving large and complex data problems. The S-ELMs divides a single large ELM network into multiple stacked small ELMs which are serially connected. The S-ELMs can approximate a very large ELM network with small memory requirement. To further improve the testing accuracy on big data problems, the ELM autoencoder can be implemented during each iteration of the S-ELMs algorithm. The simulation results show that the S-ELMs even with random hidden nodes can achieve similar testing accuracy to support vector machine (SVM) while having low memory requirements. With the help of ELM autoencoder, the S-ELMs can achieve much better testing accuracy than SVM and slightly better accuracy than deep belief network (DBN) with much faster training speed.",2015,44,119,14,False,Computer Science,Medicine,2986982,Hongming Zhou,145678691.0,G.

The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such asâomics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.",2019,106,228,5,True,Engineering,Computer Science,2665454,T.

We begin with an overview of the ways in which crowdsourcing can be used to advance machine learning research, focusing on four application areas: 1) data generation, 2) evaluation and debugging of models, 3) hybrid intelligence systems that leverage the complementary strengths of humans and machines to expand the capabilities of AI, and 4) crowdsourced behavioral experiments that improve our understanding of how humans interact with machine learning systems and technology more broadly. We next review the extensive literature on the behavior of crowdworkers themselves. This research, which explores the prevalence of dishonesty among crowdworkers, how workers respond to both monetary incentives and intrinsic forms of motivation, and how crowdworkers interact with each other, has immediate implications that we distill into best practices that researchers should follow when using crowdsourcing in their own research.

The uncertainty to explore if other machine learning algorithms can demonstrate better performance compared to the ones already employed constitutes the motivation for the study reported herein. Specifically, exploration of if certain algorithms perform better for certain attack classes and consequently, if a multi-expert classifier design can deliver desired performance measure is of high interest. This paper evaluates performance of a comprehensive set of pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms on four attack categories as found in the KDD 1999 Cup intrusion detection dataset. Results of simulation study implemented to that effect indicated that certain classification algorithms perform better for certain attack categories: a specific algorithm specialized for a given attack category . Consequently, a multi-classifier model, where a specific detection algorithm is associated with an attack category for which it is the most promising, was built. Empirical results obtained through simulation indicate that noticeable performance improvement was achieved for probing, denial of service, and user-to-root",2003,23,310,17,False,Computer Science,,2656269,Maheshkumar Sabhnani,1744384.0,G.

Its techniques are widely applied in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. This book is designed for a short course on machine learning. It is a short course, not a hurried course. From over a decade of teaching this material, we have distilled what we believe to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. We chose the title `learning from data' that faithfully describes what the subject is about, and made it a point to cover the topics in a story-like fashion. Our hope is that the reader can learn all the fundamentals of the subject by reading the book cover to cover. ---- Learning from data has distinct theoretical and practical tracks. In this book, we balance the theoretical and the practical, the mathematical and the heuristic. Our criterion for inclusion is relevance. Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems. ---- Learning from data is a very dynamic field. Some of the hot techniques and theories at times become just fads, and others gain traction and become part of the field. What we have emphasized in this book are the necessary fundamentals that give any student of learning from data a solid foundation, and enable him or her to venture out and explore further techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own. ---- The authors are professors at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and National Taiwan University (NTU), where this book is the main text for their popular courses on machine learning.

Our goal is to improve the classification accuracy of any given supervised learning algorithm by using the available unlabeled examples. We call this as the Semi-supervised improvement problem, to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing approaches. We design a metasemi-supervised learning algorithm that wraps around the underlying supervised algorithm and improves its performance using unlabeled data. This problem is particularly important when we need to train a supervised learning algorithm with a limited number of labeled examples and a multitude of unlabeled examples. We present a boosting framework for semi-supervised learning, termed as SemiBoost. The key advantages of the proposed semi-supervised learning approach are: 1) performance improvement of any supervised learning algorithm with a multitude of unlabeled data, 2) efficient computation by the iterative boosting algorithm, and 3) exploiting both manifold and cluster assumption in training classification models. An empirical study on 16 different data sets and text categorization demonstrates that the proposed framework improves the performance of several commonly used supervised learning algorithms, given a large number of unlabeled examples.
