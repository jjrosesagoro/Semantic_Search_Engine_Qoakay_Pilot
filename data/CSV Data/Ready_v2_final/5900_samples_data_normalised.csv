Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus, passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general‐purpose methods. With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general‐purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pretraining of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.",2018,59,179,13,True,Computer Science,Engineering,3198659,D.

The diversity of the members of an ensemble is known to be an important factor in determining its generalization error. This paper presents a new method for generating ensembles that directly constructs diverse hypotheses using additional artificially-constructed training examples. The technique is a simple, general metalearner that can use any strong learner as a base classifier to build diverse committees. Experimental results using decision-tree induction as a base learner demonstrate that this approach consistently achieves higher predictive accuracy than both the base classifier and bagging (whereas boosting can occasionally decrease accuracy), and also obtains higher accuracy than boosting early in the learning curve when training data is limited.",2003,22,296,15,False,Computer Science,,2780489,Prem Melville,1797655.0,R.

Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

These include local manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and LLE, support vector classifiers with Gaussian or other local kernels, and graph-based semisupervised learning algorithms using a local similarity function. These algorithms are shown to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. There is a large class of data distributions for which non-local solutions could be expressed compactly and potentially be learned with few examples, but which will require a large number of local bases and therefore a large number of training examples when using a local learning algorithm.",2005,30,81,1,False,Mathematics,,1751762,Yoshua Bengio,2460212.0,Olivier Delalleau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a new extension of the bump hunt that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms while remaining model agnostic. This approach is based on the classification without labels (CWoLa) method where the invariant mass is used to create two potentially mixed samples, one with little or no signal and one with a potential resonance. Additional features that are uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier. Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such model-agnostic approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel that would not be covered with existing techniques.",2019,82,91,4,True,Physics,,153639309,J.

Inspired by the postulates of quantum mechanics, we introduce a hierarchy of representations which meet uniqueness and target similarity criteria. To systematically control target similarity, we simply rely on interatomic many body expansions, as implemented in universal force-fields, including Bonding, Angular (BA), and higher order terms. Addition of higher order contributions systematically increases similarity to the true potential energy and predictive accuracy of the resulting ML models. We report numerical evidence for the performance of BAML models trained on molecular properties pre-calculated at electron-correlated and density functional theory level of theory for thousands of small organic molecules. Properties studied include enthalpies and free energies of atomization, heat capacity, zero-point vibrational energies, dipole-moment, polarizability, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronic excitations.

What makes them so special in the eyes of image classifiers? In this paper, we show empirically that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low probability regions of the training distribution, regardless of attack types and targeted models. Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery, we devised PixelDefend, a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier, making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result, PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses. Experiments show that our method greatly improves resilience across a wide variety of state-of-the-art attacking methods, increasing accuracy on the strongest attack from 63% to 84% for Fashion MNIST and from 32% to 70% for CIFAR-10.",2017,50,586,64,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,115504645,Yang Song,3307885.0,Taesup Kim,2388416.0,S.

Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from the implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an education tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry, and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples.

In the near future, every application on every platform will incorporate trained models to encode data-based decisions that would be impossible for developers to author. This presents a significant engineering challenge, since currently data science and modeling are largely decoupled from standard software development processes. This separation makes incorporating machine learning capabilities inside applications unnecessarily costly and difficult, and furthermore discourage developers from embracing ML in first place. In this paper we present ML.NET, a framework developed at Microsoft over the last decade in response to the challenge of making it easy to ship machine learning models in large software applications. We present its architecture, and illuminate the application demands that shaped it.

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.

Restraining or restricting the environment of the animal can simplify automatic behavior quantification, but it can also degrade the quality or alter important aspects of behavior. To enable biologists to design experiments to obtain better behavioral measurements, and computer scientists to pinpoint fruitful directions for algorithm improvement, we review known effects of artificial manipulation of the animal on behavior.

In terms of the size of the training sets, learning more than five crystal structures enabled the machine learning models to stably achieve better efficiencies than GLIDE score. We also employed the docking poses of known active compounds, in addition to the crystal structures, as positive samples of training sets.

Derived from a 1994 US Census survey, this dataset has appeared in hundreds of research papers where it served as the basis for the development and comparison of many algorithmic fairness interventions. We reconstruct a superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning. We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic variation.

The two problems we consider are: (1) determination of whether procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA sequences segments are translated to protein. An accuracy of 99.4% is reported for procaryotic DNA (E. coli) and 98.4% for eucaryotic DNA (H. Sapiens genes known to be expressed in liver); (2) determination of whether eucaryotic DNA sequence segments containing the dinucleotides ''AG'' or ''GT'' are transcribed to RNA splice junctions. Accuracy of 91.2% was achieved on intron/exon splice junctions (acceptor sites) and 92.8% on exon/intron splice junctions (donor sites). The solution of these two problems, by use of information processing algorithms operating on unannotated base sequences and without recourse to biological laboratory work, is relevant to the Human Genome Project. A variety of neural network, machine learning, and information theoretic algorithms are used. The accuracies obtained exceed those of previous investigations for which quantitative results are available in the literature. They result from an ongoing program of research that applies machine learning algorithms to the problem of determining biological function of DNA sequences.

This paper proposes an efficient box-constrained quadratic optimization algorithm for distributedly training linear support vector machines (SVMs) with large data. Our key technical contribution is an analytical solution to the problem of computing the optimal step size at each iteration, using an efficient method that requires only O(1) communication cost to ensure fast convergence. With this optimal step size, our approach is superior to other methods by possessing global linear convergence, or, equivalently, O(log(1/e)) iteration complexity for an e-accurate solution, for distributedly solving the non-strongly-convex linear SVM dual problem.

However, as the standard approach is to train the network to minimize a prediction loss, the resultant model remains ignorant to its prediction confidence. Orthogonally to Bayesian neural nets that indirectly infer prediction uncertainty through weight uncertainties, we propose explicit modeling of the same using the theory of subjective logic. By placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural net as subjective opinions and learn the function that collects the evidence leading to these opinions by a deterministic neural net from data. The resultant predictor for a multi-class classification problem is another Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are set by the continuous output of a neural net. We provide a preliminary analysis on how the peculiarities of our new loss function drive improved uncertainty estimation.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies.

This paper proposes a novel EMG classifier called cascaded kernel learning machine (CKLM) to achieve the goal of high-accuracy EMG recognition. First, the EMG signals are acquired by three surface electrodes placed on three different muscles. Second, EMG features are extracted by autoregressive model (ARM) and EMG histogram. After the feature extraction, the CKLM is performed to classify the features. CKLM is composed of two different kinds of kernel learning machines: generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). By using GDA, both the goals of the dimensionality reduction of input features and the selection of discriminating features, named kernel FisherEMG, can be reached. Then, SVM combined with one-against-one strategy is executed to classify the kernel FisherEMG. By cascading SVM with GDA, the input features will be nonlinearly mapped twice by radial-basis function (RBF). As a result, a linear optimal separating hyperplane can be found with the largest margin of separation between each pair of postures' classes in the implicit dot product feature space. In addition, we develop a digital signal processor (DSP)-based EMG classification system for the control of a multi-degrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand for the practical implementation. Based on the clinical experiments, the results show that the proposed CKLM is superior to other frequently used methods, such as k-nearest neighbor algorithm, multilayer neural network, and SVM.

User heterogeneity has imposed significant challenges to FL, which can incur drifted global models that are slow to converge. Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by refining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users, other than directly aggregating their model parameters. This approach, however, depends on a proxy dataset, making it impractical unless such prerequisite is satisfied. Moreover, the ensemble knowledge is not fully utilized to guide local model learning, which may in turn affect the quality of the aggregated model. In this work, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation approach to address heterogeneous FL, where the server learns a lightweight generator to ensemble user information in a data-free manner, which is then broadcasted to users, regulating local training using the learned knowledge as an inductive bias. Empirical studies powered by theoretical implications show that, our approach facilitates FL with better generalization performance using fewer communication rounds, compared with the state-of-the-art.",2021,58,102,23,False,Medicine,Computer Science,30451228,Zhuangdi Zhu,2110805917.0,Junyuan Hong,145487992.0,Jiayu Zhou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to damage at the very earliest stages of AD. This article seeks to evaluate critical AD-associated regional changes in the hippocampus using machine learning methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution MR images were acquired from 19 patients with AD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Regional changes of bilateral hippocampi were characterized using computational anatomic mapping methods. A feature selection method for support vector machine and leave-1-out cross-validation was introduced to determine regional shape differences that minimized the error rate in the datasets. RESULTS: Patients with AD showed significant deformations in the CA1 region of bilateral hippocampi, as well as the subiculum of the left hippocampus. There were also some changes in the CA2–4 subregions of the left hippocampus among patients with AD. Moreover, the left hippocampal surface showed greater variations than the right compared with those in healthy control subjects. The accuracies of leave-1-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation experiments for assessing the reliability of these subregions were more than 80% in bilateral hippocampi.

Data could be in various forms, such as text, images, audios, videos and signals. The essence of machine learning is to learn any patterns from features of data. In the above types of data, the number of features is massively high, which could result in the presence of a large number of irrelevant features. Most machine learning algorithms are sensitive to irrelevant features so effective evaluation and selection of features in machine learning tasks are highly important. Also, effective evaluation of features can also help identify which features are necessary to be extracted from unstructured data. In this paper, we focus on the processing of image features in classification tasks. In particular, we review two main types of feature selection techniques, namely filter and wrapper. We also review several machine learning approaches that have been used popularly in image classification, and identify the limitations of these algorithms in terms of feature evaluation.

Reinforcement learning provides an approach in which an agent interacts with the environment and learns by trial and error rather than from direct training examples. In other words, the learning task is specified by rewards and penalties that indirectly tell the agent what it is supposed to do instead of telling it how to accomplish the task. In this article we outline a framework for applying reinforcement learning to optimize the performance of conventional garbage collectors. In this project we have researched an adaptive decision process that makes decisions regarding which garbage collector technique should be invoked and how it should be applied.

Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository.

Today, the availability of high-resolution EO data products is increasing exponentially, and one of the targets is to exploit this data source for the rapid generation of landslide inventory. Conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction. We also compare this with conventional pixel-based and object-based methods. The experiment was done in Douglas County, a study area selected in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA, and landslide inventory extracted from SLIDO (Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon) was considered as the ground truth. Landslide mapping is an imbalanced learning problem with very limited availability of training data.

The multi-view SVMs tracking method is constructed based on multiple views of features and a novel combination strategy. To realize a comprehensive representation, we select three different types of features, i.e., gray scale value, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and local binary pattern (LBP), to train the corresponding SVMs. These features represent the object from the perspectives of description, detection, and recognition, respectively . In order to realize the combination of the SVMs under the multi-view learning framework, we present a novel collaborative strategy with entropy criterion, which is acquired by the confidence distribution of the candidate samples. In addition, to learn the changes of the object and the scenario, we propose a novel update scheme based on subspace evolution strategy. The new scheme can control the model update adaptively and help to address the occlusion problems .

In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BOOSTMETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. BOOSTMETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classifier or regressor. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and running time.",2011,55,83,7,False,Mathematics,Computer Science,1780381,Chunhua Shen,1752839.0,Junae Kim,36547165.0,Lei Wang,5546141.0,A.

Nowadays, developing indoor positioning systems has become an attractive research topic due to the increasing demands on ubiquitous positioning. WiFi technology has been studied for many years to provide indoor positioning services. The WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach are widely used in the literature. These systems attempt to find the perfect match between the user fingerprint and pre-defined set of grid points on the radio map. However, Fingerprints are duplicated from available Access Points (APs) and interference, which increase number of matched patterns with the user's fingerprint. In this research, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to improve the performance and to reduce the computation cost of the WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach. All proposed methods were developed and physically realized on Android-based smart phone using the IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The experimental setup was conducted in a real indoor environment in both static and dynamic modes. The performance of the proposed method was tested using K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The results show that the performance of the proposed method outperforms other indoor localization reported in the literature.

This is particularly important when the data has class-imbalance problems. Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) has been commonly used by the machine learning community in such situations, and recently researchers are starting to use Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), especially in biomedical research. However, there is no empirical study that has been conducted to compare the suitability of the two metrics. In this paper, the aim of this study is to provide insights about how AUC and MCC are compared to each other when used with classical machine learning algorithms over a range of imbalanced datasets. In our study, we utilize an earlier-proposed criteria for comparing metrics based on the degree of consistency and degree of Discriminancy to compare AUC against MCC. We carry out experiments using four machine learning algorithms on 54 imbalanced datasets, with imbalance ratios ranging from 1% to 10%. The results demonstrate that both AUC and MCC are statistically consistent with each other; however AUC is more discriminating than MCC. The same observation is noticed when evaluated on 23 balanced datasets. This suggests AUC to be a better measure than MCC in evaluating and comparing classification algorithms.",2019,24,36,3,False,Computer Science,,52449259,Chongomweru Halimu,1872191.0,Asem Kasem,2203108.0,S.

A cross-sectional database study. Objective. The aim of this study was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion. Summary of Background Data. Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery. Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class ≥3, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the accuracy of our machine learning models. Results. On the basis of AUC values, ANN and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound complications and mortality. Conclusion. Machine learning in the form of logistic regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine surgery.

This work presents a machine learning approach to question classification. Guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answer types, we develop a hierarchical classifier that classifies questions into fine-grained classes. This work also performs a systematic study of the use of semantic information sources in natural language classification tasks.

To this end, we focus on the scenario where the source adopts transmit antenna selection (TAS) as the transmission strategy. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate receiver is available to the source, while the CSI of the eavesdropper can be either known or not known at the source. By modeling the problem of TAS as a multiclass classification problem, we propose two machine learning-based schemes, namely, the support vector machine-based scheme and the naive-Bayes-based scheme, to select the optimal antenna that maximizes the secrecy performance of the considered system.

As a result, researchers have often resorted to annotating their own training and testing data. However, different researchers may annotate different classes or use different train and test splits. In addition, it is common for papers that apply machine learning for facies classification to not contain quantitative results, and rather rely solely on visual inspection of the results. All of these practices have led to subjective results and have greatly hindered our ability to compare different machine-learning models against each other and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. To address these issues, we open source a fully annotated 3D geologic model of the Netherlands F3 block. This model is based on study of the 3D seismic data in addition to 26 well logs, and it is grounded on the careful study of the geology of the region. Furthermore, we have developed two baseline models for facies classification based on a deconvolution network architecture and make their codes publicly available. Finally, we have developed a scheme for evaluating different models on this data set, and we have evaluated the results of our baseline models.

Sensory information is necessary to, for example, perform online assessment of grasp stability. We present methods to assess grasp stability based on haptic data and machine-learning methods, including AdaBoost, support vector machines (SVMs), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). In particular, we study the effect of different sensory streams to grasp stability. This includes object information such as shape; grasp information such as approach vector; tactile measurements from fingertips; and joint configuration of the hand. Sensory knowledge affects the success of the grasping process both in the planning stage (before a grasp is executed) and during the execution of the grasp (closed-loop online control). In this paper, we study both of these aspects. We propose a probabilistic learning framework to assess grasp stability and demonstrate that knowledge about grasp stability can be inferred using information from tactile sensors.

The long-term goal of an APM system is to maximize the battery life while minimizing the annoyance to the user. The state-of-the-art in commercial solutions is timeout policies. These policies switch components into their low power states based on thresholds of periods of inactivity. Unfortunately, such methods not only waste power during the periods of inactivity, but also needlessly annoy the user when they turn off components at inappropriate times. Research in APM, on the other hand, has focused more on modeling system dynamics and not on usage patterns. We propose a system that learns when to turn off components based on different user patterns. We describe the challenges of building such a system and progressively explore a range of solutions. We experiment with a direct approach that predicts when to turn off a component given usage features (e.g., historical keyboard and mouse activity, active application, history of network traffic, and history of CPU utilization). To improve performance of the direct approach we partition data based on the context and train the learning algorithms separately for each context. Context could be past idleness or any partitioning of the data that improves performance. We then propose a model-based approach that captures the temporal dynamic of system and user state, the cost of power and user annoyance, as well as the effect of power-saving actions on the user and system. Our direct approach is validated on a large data corpus collected from multiple real users where results show a considerable improvement over traditional timeout methods. INTRODUCTION Adaptive Power Management (APM) attempts to increase the perceived battery life of a laptop by turning off certain components when their services are not going to be needed. Of course, it is not known in advance which services will be needed and when. Moreover, the perceived impact of having certain services not available is much greater than the perceived impact of others. The goal of APM is to extend the battery life as much as possible with an acceptable perceived loss of performance. APM, as opposed to non-adaptive power management, attempts to make better decisions with time and to adapt to individual users. APM is an example of an autonomic system. The autonomics concept is derived from the human body’s autonomic nervous system that regulates individual organ function, and for the most part is not subject to voluntary control. An autonomic computing system controls the functioning of computer applications or systems without explicit user input. The goal of autonomic computing is to create systems that are self-managing, self-healing, and self-protecting. Autonomic computing promises to reduce expenditures associated with operations, maintenance, and support, and to significantly improve the end user’s experience. Autonomic systems ensure smooth and uninterrupted operation by monitoring the system state, diagnosing problems, identifying user context, and executing actions to fix the problems. For example, an APM system monitors the user and laptop state, diagnoses the user mood or context, and changes power states such that the user is not noticeably impacted. Autonomic systems need to naturally reason about uncertainty in both perception Intel Technology Journal, Volume 10, Issue 4, 2006 Machine Learning for Adaptive Power Management 300 and action. In an APM system, perception uncertainty arises from the fact that the user context cannot be directly observed from sensors, such as keyboard and mouse activity, or the currently active application. Actions that turn off components also generate uncertainty. They create uncertainty in terms of the time it takes to turn a component on and off and in terms of the effect it would have on the user’s context. For example, placing the machine on standby does not always take the same amount of time and sometimes the Operating System (OS) does not even allow it. If the user context is for example a measure of idleness, then going to standby, could either increase idleness if it succeeds or decrease it if it fails, hence the uncertainty. If the user context is a measure of the users’ mode of operation (e.g., working, browsing for fun) then going to standby could again change the context in an unpredictable manner. Modeling real-world phenomena as stochastic processes and sequential decision-making under uncertainty (see Figure 1) are widely used paradigms in artificial intelligence. The process of estimating these stochastic process models and the computation of optimal policies fall into the category of machine learning. Machine learning refers to the problem of constructing computer programs that automatically improve with experience. The simplest class of machine learning algorithms are classifiers, which are functions that learn (from examples) to map input patterns to output classes. For the APM domain, our algorithms learn to map laptop usage patterns (at the OS level) into power management actions as shown in Figure 2. In this paper, we first summarize past approaches to the APM problem and then describe a machine-learning approach that maps user patterns to power-saving sections. Our approach outperforms current commercial solutions such as timeout policies. We then propose a more general model-based approach that relies on building stochastic process models. We finally discuss the potential application of such models to other domains. Figure 1: A classic sequential decision-making task under uncertainty. The doctor performs treatments and diagnostic tests on the patient, which change in a stochastic manner the internal state of the patient. The doctor then observes symptoms. The optimal policy is one where in the long run the patient is made well.

Random forest has been proven to outperform the comparative classifiers in terms of recognition accuracy, stability and robustness to features, especially with a small training set. Additionally, compared with traditional methods, random forest is not easily influenced by environmental noise. Furthermore, the user-friendly parameters in random forest offer great convenience for practical engineering.

It was asserted in the literature that minutiae points, which are commonly used for fingerprint matching, are not useful for classification. We show that, to the contrary, near state-of-the-art classification accuracy rates can be achieved when applying topological data analysis (TDA) to 3-dimensional point clouds of oriented minutiae points. We also apply TDA to fingerprint ink-roll images, which yields a lower accuracy rate but still shows promise; moreover, combining the two approaches outperforms each one individually. These methods use supervised learning applied to persistent homology and allow us to explore feature selection on barcodes, an important topic at the interface between TDA and machine learning.

However, NMF has the drawback of being highly ill-posed, that is, there typically exist many different but equivalent factorizations. In this paper, we introduce a completely new way to obtaining more well-posed NMF problems whose solutions are sparser. Our technique is based on the preprocessing of the nonnegative input data matrix, and relies on the theory of M-matrices and the geometric interpretation of NMF. This approach provably leads to optimal and sparse solutions under the separability assumption of Donoho and Stodden (2003), and, for rank-three matrices, makes the number of exact factorizations finite.

The scheme is based on resampling, with multiple models being generated based on subsampling of the same training data. The accuracy of the uncertainty prediction can be benchmarked by maximum likelihood estimation, which can also be used to correct for correlations between resampled models and to improve the performance of the uncertainty estimation by a cross-validation procedure. In the case of sparse Gaussian Process Regression models, this resampled estimator can be evaluated at negligible cost. We demonstrate the reliability of these estimates for the prediction of molecular and materials energetics and for the estimation of nuclear chemical shieldings in molecular crystals. Extension to estimate the uncertainty in energy differences, forces, or other correlated predictions is straightforward. This method can be easily applied to other machine-learning schemes and will be beneficial to make data-driven predictions more reliable and to facilitate training-set optimization and active-learning strategies.",2018,62,82,1,True,Medicine,Computer Science,34778608,F.

Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this problem. Methods and Results We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using a 13‐year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD‐free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC/AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5% 10‐year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8% of the 480 “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71. In contrast, ML Risk Calculator recommended only 11.4% to take statin, and only 14.4% of “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.95, and AUC 0.92. Similar results were found for prediction of “All CVD” events. Conclusions The ML Risk Calculator outperformed the ACC/AHA Risk Calculator by recommending less drug therapy, yet missing fewer events.

In the last few years, many algorithms have been developed that exploit Tikhonov regularization theory and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. These are the so-called kernel-based methods, which include powerful approaches like regularization networks, support vector machines, and Gaussian regression. Recently, these techniques have also gained popularity in the system identification community. In both linear and nonlinear settings, kernels that incorporate information on dynamic systems, such as the smoothness and stability of the input–output map, can challenge consolidated approaches based on parametric model structures. In the classical parametric setting, the complexity of the model (the model order) needs to be chosen, typically from a finite family of alternatives, by trading bias and variance. This (discrete) model order selection step may be critical, especially when the true model does not belong to the model class. In regularization-based approaches, model complexity is controlled by tuning (continuous) regularization parameters, making the model selection step more robust. In this article, we review these new kernel-based system identification approaches and discuss extensions based on nuclear and [Formula: see text] norms.",2019,0,54,1,False,Computer Science,,1689638,A.

Machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning.

As communication systems become smarter with cognitive radio capabilities empowered by machine learning to perform critical tasks such as spectrum awareness and spectrum sharing, they also become susceptible to new vulnerabilities due to the attacks that target the machine learning applications. This paper identiﬁes the emerging attack surface of adversarial machine learning and corresponding attacks launched against wireless communications in the context of 5G systems. The focus is on attacks against (i) spectrum sharing of 5G communications with incumbent users such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band and (ii) physical layer authentication of 5G User Equipment (UE) to support network slicing. For the ﬁrst attack, the adversary transmits during data transmission or spectrum sensing periods to manipulate the signal-level inputs to the deep learning classiﬁer that is deployed at the Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) to support the 5G system. For the second attack, the adversary spoofs wireless signals with the generative adversarial network (GAN) to inﬁltrate the physical layer authentication mechanism based on a deep learning classiﬁer that is deployed at the 5G base station. Results indicate major vulnerabilities of 5G systems to adversarial machine learning. To sustain the 5G system operations in the presence of adversaries, a defense mechanism is presented to increase the uncertainty of the adversary in training the surrogate model used for launching its subsequent attacks.",2021,74,18,0,True,Computer Science,,3099456,Y.

To meet the challenge, this article proposes a novel multiclass support vector machine, which performs classification and variable selection simultaneously through an L1-norm penalized sparse representation. The proposed methodology, together with the developed regularization solution path, permits variable selection in such a situation. For the proposed methodology, a statistical learning theory is developed to quantify the generalization error in an attempt to gain insight into the basic structure of sparse learning, permitting the number of variables to greatly exceed the sample size.

To this end, various established problems with statistical inference applied in geographical settings are reviewed, based on Gould's (1970) critique. Possible solutions to the problems outlined by Gould are suggested via reviews of: (i) improved statistical methods, and (ii) recent inductive machine learning techniques. Following this, some newer problems with inference are described, emerging from the increased complexity of geographical datasets and from the analysis tasks to which we put them. Again, some solutions are suggested by pointing to newer methods. By way of results, questions are posed, and answered, relating to the changes brought about by adopting inductive machine learning methods for geographical analysis. Specifically, these questions relate to analysis capabilities, methodologies, the role of the geographer and consequences for teaching and learning. Conclusions argue that there is now a strong need, motivated from many perspectives, to give geographical data a stronger voice, thus favouring techniques that minimize the prior assumptions made of a dataset.",2003,120,76,6,False,Computer Science,,1801583,M.
