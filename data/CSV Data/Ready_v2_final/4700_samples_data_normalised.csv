TUX2 inherits the benefits of an elegant graph computation model, efficient graph layout, and balanced parallelism to scale to billion-edge graphs; we extend and optimize it for distributed machine learning to support heterogeneity, a Stale Synchronous Parallel model, and a new MEGA (Mini-batch, Exchange, GlobalSync, and Apply) model. We have developed a set of representative distributed machine learning algorithms in TUX2, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. Compared to implementations on distributedmachine learning platforms, writing these algorithms in TUX2 takes only about 25% of the code: Our graph computation model hides the detailed management of data layout, partitioning, and parallelism from developers. Our extensive evaluation of TUX2, using large data sets with up to 64 billion edges, shows that TUX2 outperforms state-of-the-art distributed graph engines PowerGraph and PowerLyra by an order of magnitude, while beating two state-of-the-art distributed machine learning systems by at least 48%.",2017,43,53,2,False,Computer Science,9754946,Wencong Xiao,2870618.0,Jilong Xue,11009920.0,Youshan Miao,1700892.0,Z.

However, applying machine learning is challenging due to the possibility of executing unsafe actions and slow learning rates. We address these issues by presenting a reinforcement learning-based approach, which is combined with formal safety verification to ensure that only safe actions are chosen at any time. We let a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent learn to drive as close as possible to a desired velocity by executing reasonable lane changes on simulated highways with an arbitrary number of lanes. By making use of a minimal state representation, consisting of only 13 continuous features, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN), we are able to achieve fast learning rates.

This paper proposes a new extreme learning machine (ELM)-based cross-domain network learning framework, that is called ELM-based Domain Adaptation (EDA). It allows us to learn a category transformation and an ELM classifier with random projection by minimizing the ℓ2,1-norm of the network output weights and the learning error simultaneously. The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during cross-domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing classifiers can be readily incorporated as the base classifiers. The network output weights cannot only be analytically determined, but also transferrable. In addition, a manifold regularization with Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to semisupervised learning. Extensively, we also propose a model of multiple views, referred as MvEDA. Experiments on benchmark visual datasets for video event recognition and object recognition demonstrate that our EDA methods outperform the existing cross-domain learning methods.",2016,61,137,5,False,Computer Science,36685537,Lei Zhang,66396175.0,D.

In this paper, we investigate a framework of Multi-Layer Multiple Kernel Learning (MLMKL) that aims to learn “deep” kernel machines by exploring the combinations of multiple kernels in a multi-layer structure, which goes beyond the conventional MKL approach. Through a multiple layer mapping, the proposed MLMKL framework offers higher flexibility than the regular MKL for finding the optimal kernel for applications.

We train models to predict these design choices using one million dataset-visualization pairs collected from a popular online visualization platform. Neural networks predict these design choices with high accuracy compared to baseline models. We report and interpret feature importances from one of these baseline models.

The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods).

Many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available heuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple, analytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution regression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage sampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched with kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency trade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one-stage sampled minimax optimal rate [Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al., 2009]. This result answers a 17-year-old open question, establishing the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002] in regression.

While server sharing among jobs improves resource utilization, interference among co-located ML jobs can lead to significant performance downgrade. Existing cluster schedulers (e.g., Mesos) are interference-oblivious in their job placement, causing suboptimal resource efficiency. Interference-aware job placement has been studied in the literature, but was treated using detailed workload profiling and interference modeling, which is not a general solution. This paper presents Harmony, a deep learning-driven ML cluster scheduler that places training jobs in a manner that minimizes interference and maximizes performance (i.e., training completion time). Harmony is based on a carefully designed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework augmented with reward modeling. The DRL employs state-of-the-art techniques to stabilize training and improve convergence, including actor-critic algorithm, job-aware action space exploration and experience replay. In view of a common lack of reward samples corresponding to different placement decisions, we build an auxiliary reward prediction model, which is trained using historical samples and used for producing reward for unseen placement. Experiments using real ML workloads in a Kubernetes cluster of 6 GPU servers show that Harmony outperforms representative schedulers by 25% in terms of average job completion time.",2019,35,58,5,False,Computer Science,3393850,Yixin Bao,9561490.0,Yanghua Peng,1726963.0,Chuan Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library.

As machine-learning models are increasingly being used in sensitive application domains (e.g. education and employment) for decision making, it is crucial that the decisions computed by such models are free of unintended bias. But how can we automatically validate the fairness of arbitrary machine-learning models? For a given machine-learning model and a set of sensitive input parameters, our Aequitas approach automatically discovers discriminatory inputs that highlight fairness violation. At the core of Aequitas are three novel strategies to employ probabilistic search over the input space with the objective of uncovering fairness violation. Our Aequitas approach leverages inherent robustness property in common machine-learning models to design and implement scalable test generation methodologies. An appealing feature of our generated test inputs is that they can be systematically added to the training set of the underlying model and improve its fairness. To this end, we design a fully automated module that guarantees to improve the fairness of the model. We implemented Aequitas and we have evaluated it on six state-of-the-art classifiers. Our subjects also include a classifier that was designed with fairness in mind. We show that Aequitas effectively generates inputs to uncover fairness violation in all the subject classifiers and systematically improves the fairness of respective models using the generated test inputs.

A relatively smaller body of work, however, addresses the similarities between learning dynamics employed in deep artificial neural networks and synaptic plasticity in spiking neural networks. The challenge preventing this is largely caused by the discrepancy between the dynamical properties of synaptic plasticity and the requirements for gradient backpropagation. Learning algorithms that approximate gradient backpropagation using local error functions can overcome this challenge. Here, we introduce Deep Continuous Local Learning (DECOLLE), a spiking neural network equipped with local error functions for online learning with no memory overhead for computing gradients. DECOLLE is capable of learning deep spatio temporal representations from spikes relying solely on local information, making it compatible with neurobiology and neuromorphic hardware. Synaptic plasticity rules are derived systematically from user-defined cost functions and neural dynamics by leveraging existing autodifferentiation methods of machine learning frameworks. We benchmark our approach on the event-based neuromorphic dataset N-MNIST and DvsGesture, on which DECOLLE performs comparably to the state-of-the-art.

Here we show that machine learning can be used to identify central quantum protocols, including teleportation, entanglement purification and the quantum repeater. These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication, and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness of learning agents goes beyond the mere re-production of known protocols; the same approach allows one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing with asymmetric situations where channel noise and segment distance are non-uniform. Our findings are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions.

One of the main problems of using appearance-based discriminative models is the ambiguities among classes when the number of persons being considered increases. To reduce the amount of ambiguity, we propose the use of a rich set of feature descriptors based on color, textures and edges. Another issue regarding appearance modeling is the limited number of training samples available for each appearance. The discriminative models are created using a powerful statistical tool called Partial Least Squares (PLS), responsible for weighting the features according to their discriminative power for each different appearance. The experimental results, based on appearance-based person recognition, demonstrate that the use of an enriched feature set analyzed by PLS reduces the ambiguity among different appearances and provides higher recognition rates when compared to other machine learning techniques.",2009,22,374,49,True,Computer Science,9385043,W.

In this survey, we provide an in-depth review of the role of Bayesian methods for the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The major incentives for incorporating Bayesian reasoning in RL are: 1) it provides an elegant approach to action-selection (exploration/exploitation) as a function of the uncertainty in learning; and 2) it provides a machinery to incorporate prior knowledge into the algorithms. We first discuss models and methods for Bayesian inference in the simple single-step Bandit model. We then review the extensive recent literature on Bayesian methods for model-based RL, where prior information can be expressed on the parameters of the Markov model. We also present Bayesian methods for model-free RL, where priors are expressed over the value function or policy class.

Mind Bugs combines a novel cognitive simulation process with careful hypothesis testing to explore how mathematics students acquire procedural skills in instructional settings, focusing in particular on these procedural misconceptions and what they reveal about the learning process. VanLehn develops a theory of learning that explains how students develop procedural misconceptions that cause systematic errors. He describes a computer program, ""Sierra,"" that simulates learning processes and predicts exactly what types of procedural errors should occur. These predictions are tested with error data from several thousand subjects from schools all over the world. Moreover, each hypothesis of the theory is tested individually by determining how the predictions would change if it were removed from the theory. Integrating ideas from research in machine learning, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and linguistics, Mind Bugs specifically addresses error patterns on subtraction tests, showing, for example, why some students have an imperfect understanding of the rules for borrowing. Alternative explanatory hypotheses are explored by incorporating them in Sierra in place of the primary hypotheses, and seeing if the program still explains all the subtraction bugs that it explained before.

There are subtle differences in how exactly to compute accuracy, F-measure and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in cross-validation studies. However, these details are not discussed in the literature, and incompatible methods are used by various papers and software packages. This leads to inconsistency across the research literature. Anomalies in performance calculations for particular folds and situations go undiscovered when they are buried in aggregated results over many folds and datasets, without ever a person looking at the intermediate performance measurements. This research note clarifies and illustrates the differences, and it provides guidance for how best to measure classification performance under cross-validation. In particular, there are several divergent methods used for computing F-measure, which is often recommended as a performance measure under class imbalance, e.g., for text classification domains and in one-vs.-all reductions of datasets having many classes. We show by experiment that all but one of these computation methods leads to biased measurements, especially under high class imbalance.

A potential remedy is offered by multi-task learning: in many cases, while individual sample sizes are rather small, there are samples to represent a large number of learning tasks (linear regression problems), which share some constraining or generative property. If this property is sufficiently simple it should allow for better learning of the individual tasks despite their small individual sample sizes. In this talk I will review a wide class of multi-task learning methods which encourage low-dimensional representations of the regression vectors. I will describe techniques to solve the underlying optimization problems and present an analysis of the generalization performance of these learning methods which provides a proof of the superiority of multi-task learning under specific conditions.

Although legal scholars have generally assumed that algorithmic collusion is not only possible but also exceptionally easy, computer scientists examining cooperation between algorithms as well as economists investigating collusion in experimental oligopolies have countered that coordinated, tacitly collusive behavior is not as rapid, easy, or even inevitable as often suggested. Research in experimental economics has shown that the exchange of information is vital to collusion when more than two firms operate within a given market. Communication between algorithms is also a topic in research on artificial intelligence, in which some scholars have recently indicated that algorithms can learn to communicate, albeit in somewhat limited ways. Taken together, algorithmic collusion currently seems far more difficult to achieve than legal scholars have often assumed and is thus not a particularly relevant competitive concern at present. Moreover, there are several legal problems associated with algorithmic collusion, including questions of liability, of auditing and monitoring algorithms, and of enforcing competition law.",2018,111,55,5,False,Computer Science,40482477,Ulrich Schwalbe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length (either due to brief recordings or previous trajectory segmentation) and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate single trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with high accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to determine the anomalous exponent with a small error, thus inherently providing a classification of the motion as normal or anomalous (sub- or super-diffusion). The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise.

While standard SVMs have been basically only applied to static problems like classification and function estimation, LS-SVM models have been extended to recurrent models and use in optimal control problems.

In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are ""actionable."" These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks.

Although studies have applied machine learning methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD, a bottleneck in the diagnostic performance was shown in previous methods, due to the lacking of efficient strategies for representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one setting and has the potential to require less labeled data.

The challenge with this approach lies in accurately estimating the normalizing constant of the high-dimensional energy function. We propose the Autoregressive Energy Machine, an energy-based model which simultaneously learns an unnormalized density and computes an importance-sampling estimate of the normalizing constant for each conditional in an autoregressive decomposition.

The affinities were modeled using qualitative classification or quantitative regression schemes involving linear, nonlinear, and deep neural network (DNN) machine-learning methods used in the scientific literature for quantitative-structure activity relationships (QSAR).

The machine-learning methods investigated herein performed well in both the qualitative classification (∼70% accuracy) and quantitative IC50 predictions (RMSE ∼ 1 log).

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.

Recently it has been addressed using neural networks, in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). These are fully differentiable computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming. Despite their appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they are not parallel and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded. We present a neural network architecture to address this problem: the Neural GPU. It is based on a type of convolutional gated recurrent unit and, like the NTM, is computationally universal. Unlike the NTM, the Neural GPU is highly parallel which makes it easier to train and efficient to run. An essential property of algorithms is their ability to handle inputs of arbitrary size. We show that the Neural GPU can be trained on short instances of an algorithmic task and successfully generalize to long instances. We verified it on a number of tasks including long addition and long multiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the Neural GPU on numbers with upto 20 bits and observe no errors whatsoever while testing it, even on much longer numbers. To achieve these results we introduce a technique for training deep recurrent networks: parameter sharing relaxation.

The SVM is well understood when using conditionally positive definite (cpd) kernel functions. However, in practice, non-cpd kernels arise and demand application in SVM. The procedure of ""plugging"" these indefinite kernels in SVM often yields good empirical classification results. However, they are hard to interpret due to missing geometrical and theoretical understanding. In this paper, we provide a step toward the comprehension of SVM classifiers in these situations. We give a geometric interpretation of SVM with indefinite kernel functions. We show that such SVM are optimal hyperplane classifiers not by margin maximization, but by minimization of distances between convex hulls in pseudo-Euclidean spaces. By this, we obtain a sound framework and motivation for indefinite SVM. This interpretation is the basis for further theoretical analysis, e.g., investigating uniqueness, and for the derivation of practical guidelines like characterizing the suitability of indefinite SVM.",2005,32,255,18,True,Mathematics,2800929,B.

To develop effective machine learning services, there is a must to exploit data from such distributed databases without exchanging the raw data. Recently, federated learning (FL) has been a solution with growing interests, which enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without exchanging their local data. A key and common challenge on distributed databases is the heterogeneity of the data distribution among the parties. The data of different parties are usually non-independently and identically distributed (i.e., non-IID). There have been many FL algorithms to address the learning effectiveness under non-IID data settings. However, there lacks an experimental study on systematically understanding their advantages and disadvantages, as previous studies have very rigid data partitioning strategies among parties, which are hardly representative and thorough. In this paper, to help researchers better understand and study the non-IID data setting in federated learning, we propose comprehensive data partitioning strategies to cover the typical non-IID data cases. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art FL algorithms. We find that non-IID does bring significant challenges in learning accuracy of FL algorithms, and none of the existing state-of-the-art FL algorithms outperforms others in all cases.

Unlike English as a Second Language ( ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3 D virtual world, Open Simulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts ( VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot ( VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine ( VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine ( VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.

Such ordinal measures have rarely been applied in treatment of numeric features as a representational transformation. We emphasize the benefits of ordinal representations of input features both theoretically and empirically. We present a family of algorithms for computing ordinal embeddings based on partial order statistics. Apart from having the stability benefits of ordinal measures, these embeddings are highly nonlinear, giving rise to sparse feature spaces highly favored by several machine learning methods. These embeddings are deterministic, data independent and by virtue of being based on partial order statistics, add another degree of resilience to noise. These machine-learning-free methods when applied to the task of fast similarity search outperform state-of-the-art machine learning methods with complex optimization setups. For solving classification problems, the embeddings provide a nonlinear transformation resulting in sparse binary codes that are well-suited for a large class of machine learning algorithms. These methods show significant improvement on VOC 2010 using simple linear classifiers which can be trained quickly. Our method can be extended to the case of polynomial kernels, while permitting very efficient computation. Further, since the popular Min Hash algorithm is a special case of our method, we demonstrate an efficient scheme for computing Min Hash on conjunctions of binary features.

Hundreds of code transformations, compiler flags, architectural features and optimization parameters result in a search space that can take many machinemonths to explore exhaustively. Inspired by successes in the systems community, we apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to explore this space more intelligently. On 7-point and 27-point stencil code, our technique takes about two hours to discover a configuration whose performance is within 1% of and up to 18% better than that achieved by a human expert. This factor of 2000 speedup over manual exploration of the auto-tuning parameter space enables us to explore optimizations that were previously off-limits.

Seq2seq builds on deep neural language modeling and inherits its remarkable accuracy in estimating local, next-word distributions. In this work, we introduce a model and beam-search training scheme, based on the work of Daume III and Marcu (2005), that extends seq2seq to learn global sequence scores. This structured approach avoids classical biases associated with local training and unifies the training loss with the test-time usage, while preserving the proven model architecture of seq2seq and its efficient training approach.

Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive, lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

However, identifying and prioritizing students who need those interventions the most remains challenging. This paper describes a machine learning framework to identify such students, discusses features that are useful for this task, applies several classification algorithms, and evaluates them using metrics important to school administrators. To help test this framework and make it practically useful, we partnered with two U.S. school districts with a combined enrollment of approximately 200,000 students. We together designed several evaluation metrics to assess the goodness of machine learning algorithms from an educator's perspective.

Random Forest approach achieves validation errors less than 1% in comparison to the well-known ML algorithms under a valuation. In order to reduce automatically the number of monitored parameters, needed to predict software anomalies, we analyze Lasso Regularization technique jointly with the Machine Learning classifiers to evaluate how the prediction accuracy could be guaranteed within an acceptable threshold.

Unfortunately, from a performance point of view getting the most out of Hadoop is still a big challenge due to the large number of configuration parameters. Currently these parameters are tuned manually by trial and error, which is ineffective due to the large parameter space and the complex interactions among the parameters. Even worse, the parameters have to be re-tuned for different MapReduce applications and clusters. To make the parameter tuning process more effective, in this paper we explore machine learning-based performance models that we use to auto-tune the configuration parameters. To this end, we first evaluate several machine learning models with diverse MapReduce applications and cluster configurations, and we show that support vector regression model (SVR) has good accuracy and is also computationally efficient. We further assess our auto-tuning approach, which uses the SVR performance model, against the Starfish auto tuner, which uses a cost-based performance model. Our findings reveal that our auto-tuning approach can provide comparable or in some cases better performance improvements than Starfish with a smaller number of parameters. Finally, we propose and discuss a complete and practical end-to-end auto-tuning flow that combines our machine learning-based performance models with smart search algorithms for the effective training of the models and the effective exploration of the parameter space.",2013,20,94,9,False,Computer Science,3160525,N.

Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, and (2) accelerated schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the sequence of fast weights generated by another optimizer. We show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible computation and memory cost. We empirically demonstrate Lookahead can significantly improve the performance of SGD and Adam, even with their default hyperparameter settings on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, neural machine translation, and Penn Treebank.",2019,51,450,69,False,Computer Science,50495487,Michael Ruogu Zhang,145202377.0,James Lucas,1695689.0,Geoffrey E.
