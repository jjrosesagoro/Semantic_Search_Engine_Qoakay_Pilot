Identification of anticancer peptides (ACPs) through wet-lab experimentation is expensive and often time consuming; therefore, development of an efficient computational method is essential to identify potential ACP candidates prior to in vitro experimentation. In this study, we developed support vector machine- and random forest-based machine-learning methods for the prediction of ACPs using the features calculated from the amino acid sequence, including amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, atomic composition, and physicochemical properties. We trained our methods using the Tyagi-B dataset and determined the machine parameters by 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our methods on two benchmarking datasets, with our results showing that the random forest-based method outperformed the existing methods with an average accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient value of 88.7% and 0.78, respectively.

As the demands of performance and integration level keep increasing, the design and optimization of nanophotonic devices become computationally expensive and time-inefficient. Advanced computational methods and artificial intelligence, especially its subfield of machine learning, have led to revolutionary development in many applications, such as web searches, computer vision, and speech/image recognition. The complex models and algorithms help to exploit the enormous parameter space in a highly efficient way. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the emerging field where nanophotonics and machine learning blend. We provide an overview of different computational methods, with the focus on deep learning, for the nanophotonic inverse design. The implementation of deep neural networks with photonic platforms is also discussed. This review aims at sketching an illustration of the nanophotonic design with machine learning and giving a perspective on the future tasks.",2018,237,170,2,True,Physics,2305129,Kan Yao,1944881178.0,R.

In the context of a simple model of online decision making, we give an algorithm that satisfies this fairness constraint, while still being able to learn at a rate that is comparable to (but necessarily worse than) that of the best algorithms absent a fairness constraint. We prove a regret bound for fair algorithms in the linear contextual bandit framework that is a significant improvement over our technical companion paper [16], which gives black-box reductions in a more general setting. We analyze our algorithms both theoretically and experimentally.

However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior -- often referred to as gaming -- the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming. We model classification as a sequential game between a player named ""Jury"" and a player named ""Contestant."" Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier drawn from a distribution. Before being classified, Contestant may change his input based on Jury's classifier. However, Contestant incurs a cost for these changes according to a cost function. Jury's goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's original input and some underlying target classification function, assuming Contestant plays best response. Contestant's goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account the cost of achieving it. For a natural class of ""separable"" cost functions, and certain generalizations, we obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms which are near optimal, achieving a classification error that is arbitrarily close to the theoretical minimum. Surprisingly, our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn. For general cost functions, designing an approximately optimal strategy-proof classifier, for inverse-polynomial approximation, is NP-hard.",2015,15,215,25,True,Computer Science,1775622,Moritz Hardt,1706816.0,N.

Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set function subject to cardinality constraints. Classical approaches require centralized access to the full data set; but for truly large-scale problems, rendering the data centrally is often impractical. In this paper, we consider the problem of submodular function maximization in a distributed fashion. We develop a simple, two-stage protocol GREEDI, that is easily implemented using MapReduce style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and show, that under certain natural conditions, performance close to the (impractical) centralized approach can be achieved. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, including sparse Gaussian process inference and exemplar-based clustering, on tens of millions of data points using Hadoop.",2013,35,248,29,False,Computer Science,2389094,Baharan Mirzasoleiman,1697131.0,Amin Karbasi,2810893.0,R.

The latter problem is motivated by recent applications within bioinformatics, particularly gene expression analysis. For both problems, we identify classes of data distributions for which there exist consistent, polynomial-time algorithms. We also prove that ALL-RELEVANT is much harder than MINIMAL-OPTIMAL and propose two consistent, polynomial-time algorithms.

The performance of predictive modeling is dependent on the amount and quality of available data. In practice, we rely on human experts to perform certain tasks and on machine learning for others. However, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of humans and machines. We present expert-augmented machine learning, an automated way to automatically extract problem-specific human expert knowledge and integrate it with machine learning to build robust, dependable, and data-efficient predictive models. Machine learning is proving invaluable across disciplines. However, its success is often limited by the quality and quantity of available data, while its adoption is limited by the level of trust afforded by given models. Human vs. machine performance is commonly compared empirically to decide whether a certain task should be performed by a computer or an expert. In reality, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of humans and machines. Here, we present expert-augmented machine learning (EAML), an automated method that guides the extraction of expert knowledge and its integration into machine-learned models. We used a large dataset of intensive-care patient data to derive 126 decision rules that predict hospital mortality. Using an online platform, we asked 15 clinicians to assess the relative risk of the subpopulation defined by each rule compared to the total sample. We compared the clinician-assessed risk to the empirical risk and found that, while clinicians agreed with the data in most cases, there were notable exceptions where they overestimated or underestimated the true risk. Studying the rules with greatest disagreement, we identified problems with the training data, including one miscoded variable and one hidden confounder. Filtering the rules based on the extent of disagreement between clinician-assessed risk and empirical risk, we improved performance on out-of-sample data and were able to train with less data.

Nowadays, OS are shipped with thousands of binary executables. Unfortunately, methodologies and tools for an OS scale program testing within a limited time budget are still missing. In this paper we present an approach that uses lightweight static and dynamic features to predict if a test case is likely to contain a software vulnerability using machine learning techniques.

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.",2013,45,370,27,False,Computer Science,1751762,Yoshua Bengio,1398746441.0,Eric Thibodeau-Laufer,1815021.0,Guillaume Alain,2965424.0,J.

An attribute-oriented induction method has been developed for knowledge discovery in databases. The method integrates a machine learning paradigm, especially learning-from-examples techniques, with set-oriented database operations and extracts generalized data from actual data in databases. An attribute-oriented concept tree ascension technique is applied in generalization, which substantially reduces the computational complex@ of database learning processes. Different kinas of knowledge rules, including characteristic rules, discrimination rules, quantitative rules, and data evolution regularities can be discovered efficiently using the attribute-oriented approach. In addition to learning in relational databases, the approach can be applied to knowledge discovery in nested relational and deductive databases. Learning can also be performed with databases containing noisy data and exceptional cases using database statistics. Furthermore, the rules discovered can be used to query database knowledge, answer cooperative queries and facilitate semantic query optimization.

In particular, networks using second-order units have been successful at this task. In studying the performance and learning behavior of such networks we have found that the second-order network model attempts to form clusters in activation space as its internal representation of states. However, these learned states become unstable as longer and longer test input strings are presented to the network. In essence, the network forgets where the individual states are in activation space. In this paper we propose a new method to force such a network to learn stable states by introducing discretization into the network and using a pseudo-gradient learning rule to perform training. The essence of the learning rule is that in doing gradient descent, it makes use of the gradient of a sigmoid function as a heuristic hint in place of that of the hard-limiting function, while still using the discretized value in the feedback update path. The new structure uses isolated points in activation space instead of vague clusters as its internal representation of states. It is shown to have similar capabilities in learning finite state automata as the original network, but without the instability problem. The proposed pseudo-gradient learning rule may also be used as a basis for training other types of networks that have hard-limiting threshold activation functions.",1993,25,147,16,True,Computer Science,2075413715,Zheng Zeng,145135018.0,R.

We (i) propose a novel gossip-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm, CHOCO-SGD, that converges at rate $\mathcal{O}\left(1/(nT) + 1/(T \delta^2 \omega)^2\right)$ for strongly convex objectives, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\delta$ the eigengap of the connectivity matrix. Despite compression quality and network connectivity affecting the higher order terms, the first term in the rate, $\mathcal{O}(1/(nT))$, is the same as for the centralized baseline with exact communication. We (ii) present a novel gossip algorithm, CHOCO-GOSSIP, for the average consensus problem that converges in time $\mathcal{O}(1/(\delta^2\omega) \log (1/\epsilon))$ for accuracy $\epsilon > 0$. This is (up to our knowledge) the first gossip algorithm that supports arbitrary compressed messages for $\omega > 0$ and still exhibits linear convergence. We (iii) show in experiments that both of our algorithms do outperform the respective state-of-the-art baselines and CHOCO-SGD can reduce communication by at least two orders of magnitudes.",2019,58,284,46,False,Computer Science,51904731,Anastasia Koloskova,2127057.0,Sebastian U.

We sought to compare the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 2010 patients who underwent open heart surgery and thoracic aortic surgery. Baseline medical condition, intraoperative anesthesia, and surgery-related data were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, neural network classifier, and deep learning. The performance of these techniques was compared with that of logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). During the first postoperative week, AKI occurred in 770 patients (38.3%). The best performance regarding AUC was achieved by the gradient boosting machine to predict the AKI of all stages (0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75‚Äì0.80) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUC of logistic regression analysis was 0.69 (95% CI 0.66‚Äì0.72). Decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine showed similar performance to logistic regression. In our comprehensive comparison of machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, gradient boosting technique showed the best performance with the highest AUC and lower error rate.

This exposes learning algorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which a fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated to subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only against a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent complexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning points (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we first extend the definition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel poisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to compute the gradient of interest through automatic differentiation, while also reversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity. Compared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a wider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient-based procedures, including neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically evaluate its effectiveness on several application examples, including spam filtering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition.

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate that domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a practical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks.",2019,76,97,11,True,Computer Science,47994360,H.

While there has been an explosion of work on differentially private machine learning algorithms, a major barrier to achieving end-to-end differential privacy in practical machine learning applications is the lack of an effective procedure for differentially private parameter tuning, or, determining the parameter value, such as a bin size in a histogram, or a regularization parameter, that is suitable for a particular application. In this paper, we introduce a generic validation procedure for differentially private machine learning algorithms that apply when a certain stability condition holds on the training algorithm and the validation performance metric. The training data size and the privacy budget used for training in our procedure is independent of the number of parameter values searched over.

In providing an in-depth characterization of membership privacy risks against machine learning models, this paper presents a comprehensive study towards demystifying membership inference attacks from two complimentary perspectives. First, we provide a generalized formulation of the development of a black-box membership inference attack model. Second, we characterize the importance of model choice on model vulnerability through a systematic evaluation of a variety of machine learning models and model combinations using multiple datasets. Through formal analysis and empirical evidence from extensive experimentation, we characterize under what conditions a model may be vulnerable to such black-box membership inference attacks. We show that membership inference vulnerability is data-driven and corresponding attack models are largely transferable. Though different model types display different vulnerabilities to membership inference, so do different datasets. Our empirical results additionally show that (1) using the type of target model under attack within the attack model may not increase attack effectiveness and (2) collaborative learning exposes vulnerabilities to membership inference risks when the adversary is a participant.

This may be especially important in practical terms when real-world applications of the classifier are either highly imbalanced or occur in unknown proportions. Intuitively, it may seem sensible to train machine learning models on data similar to the target data in terms of proportions of the two binary outcomes. However, we show that this is not the case using the example of prediction of deleterious and neutral phenotypes of human missense mutations in human genome data, for which the proportion of the binary outcome is unknown. Our results indicate that using balanced training data (50% neutral and 50% deleterious) results in the highest balanced accuracy (the average of True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate), Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under ROC curves, no matter what the proportions of the two phenotypes are in the testing data. Besides balancing the data by undersampling the majority class, other techniques in machine learning include oversampling the minority class, interpolating minority-class data points and various penalties for misclassifying the minority class. However, these techniques are not commonly used in either the missense phenotype prediction problem or in the prediction of disordered residues in proteins, where the imbalance problem is substantial. The appropriate approach depends on the amount of available data and the specific problem at hand.",2013,87,208,4,True,Medicine,48477610,Qiong Wei,2656699.0,Roland L.

Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coffiecients, average treatment e ffects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimators of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly. For example, the resulting estimators may formally have inferior rates of convergence with respect to the sample size n caused by regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Speci ficially, we can form an efficient score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The efficient score may then be used to build an efficient estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/v n rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, allowing simple construction of valid con fidence intervals for parameters of interest. The resulting method thus could be called a ""double ML"" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. Such double ML estimators achieve the fastest rates of convergence and exhibit robust good behavior with respect to a broader class of probability distributions than naive ""single"" ML estimators. In order to avoid overfi tting, following [3], our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross- fitting. The use of sample splitting allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregates of these methods (e.g. a hybrid of a random forest and lasso). We illustrate the application of the general theory through application to the leading cases of estimation and inference on the main parameter in a partially linear regression model and estimation and inference on average treatment eff ects and average treatment e ffects on the treated under conditional random assignment of the treatment. These applications cover randomized control trials as a special case. We then use the methods in an empirical application which estimates the e ffect of 401(k) eligibility on accumulated financial assets.",2016,65,161,24,True,Mathematics,26331346,V.

The virtues of neural networks as unbiased function approximants make them particularly suited for this task. An algorithm that implements this idea is constructed, as a straightforward application of the likelihood-ratio hypothesis test. The algorithm compares observations with an auxiliary set of reference-distributed events, possibly obtained with a Monte Carlo event generator. It returns a $p$ value, which measures the compatibility of the reference model with the data. It also identifies the most discrepant phase-space region of the data set, to be selected for further investigation. The most interesting potential applications are model-independent new physics searches, although our approach could also be used to compare the theoretical predictions of different Monte Carlo event generators, or for data validation algorithms. In this work we study the performance of our algorithm on a few simple examples. The results confirm the model independence of the approach, namely that it displays good sensitivity to a variety of putative signals. Furthermore, we show that the reach does not depend much on whether a favorable signal region is selected based on prior expectations.

However, several previous studies have indicated that the performance of active learning is easily disrupted by an imbalanced data distribution. Some existing imbalanced active learning approaches also suffer from either low performance or high time consumption. To address these problems, this paper describes an efficient solution based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model, called active online-weighted ELM (AOW-ELM). The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the reasons why active learning can be disrupted by an imbalanced instance distribution and its influencing factors are discussed in detail; 2) the hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to select initially labeled instances in order to avoid the missed cluster effect and cold start phenomenon as much as possible; 3) the weighted ELM (WELM) is selected as the base classifier to guarantee the impartiality of instance selection in the procedure of active learning, and an efficient online updated mode of WELM is deduced in theory; and 4) an early stopping criterion that is similar to but more flexible than the margin exhaustion criterion is presented. The experimental results on 32 binary-class data sets with different imbalance ratios demonstrate that the proposed AOW-ELM algorithm is more effective and efficient than several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms that are specifically designed for the class imbalance scenario.",2019,55,70,5,False,Computer Science,145191483,Hualong Yu,2290382.0,Xibei Yang,2111070500.0,Shang Zheng,145928755.0,Changyin Sun,,,,,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts have been made to identify DNA-BPs based on their sequence and structural information with moderate accuracy. Here we develop a machine learning protocol for the prediction of DNA-BPs where the classifier is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Information used for classification is derived from characteristics that include surface and overall composition, overall charge and positive potential patches on the protein surface. In total 121 DNA-BPs and 238 non-binding proteins are used to build and evaluate the protocol. In self-consistency, accuracy value of 100% has been achieved. For cross-validation (CV) optimization over entire dataset, we report an accuracy of 90%. Using leave 1-pair holdout evaluation, the accuracy of 86.3% has been achieved. When we restrict the dataset to less than 20% sequence identity amongst the proteins, the holdout accuracy is achieved at 85.8%. Furthermore, seven DNA-BPs with unbounded structures are all correctly predicted. The current performances are better than results published previously. The higher accuracy value achieved here originates from two factors: the ability of the SVM to handle features that demonstrate a wide range of discriminatory power and, a different definition of the positive patch. Since our protocol does not lean on sequence or structural homology, it can be used to identify or predict proteins with DNA-binding function(s) regardless of their homology to the known ones.",2005,45,149,8,True,Biology,39739035,N.

However, even though dozens of anomaly detectors have been proposed over the years, deploying them to a given service remains a great challenge, requiring manually and iteratively tuning detector parameters and thresholds. This paper tackles this challenge through a novel approach based on supervised machine learning. With our proposed system, Opprentice (Operators' apprentice), operators' only manual work is to periodically label the anomalies in the performance data with a convenient tool. Multiple existing detectors are applied to the performance data in parallel to extract anomaly features.

Advances in the field of automatic facial expression measurement will require development and assessment on spontaneous behavior. Here we present preliminary results on a task of facial action detection in spontaneous facial expressions.

This paper focuses on a class of regularized empirical risk minimization machine learning problems, and develops two methods to provide differential privacy to distributed learning algorithms over a network. We first decentralize the learning algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers, and propose the methods of dual variable perturbation and primal variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential privacy. The two mechanisms lead to algorithms that can provide privacy guarantees under mild conditions of the convexity and differentiability of the loss function and the regularizer. We study the performance of the algorithms, and show that the dual variable perturbation outperforms its primal counterpart.

Furthermore, a single-task unified MEGNet model can accurately predict the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, with temperature, pressure and entropy being global state inputs. Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on $\sim 60,000$ crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than DFT accuracy over a much larger data set. Such MEGNet models are highly interpretable, and well-established periodic chemical trends can be extracted from the elemental embeddings.

It has been shown that object recognizers using kernel-SVMs can be elegantly adapted to localization by means of spatial perturbation of the SVM. While this SVM applies to each frame of a video independently of other frames, the benefits of temporal fusion of data are well-known. This is addressed here by using a fully probabilistic relevance vector machine (RVM) to generate observations with Gaussian distributions that can be fused over time. Rather than adapting a recognizer, we build a displacement expert which directly estimates displacement from the target region. An object detector is used in tandem, for object verification, providing the capability for automatic initialization and recovery. This approach is demonstrated in real-time tracking systems where the sparsity of the RVM means that only a fraction of CPU time is required to track at frame rate.

Toward that goal, the authors propose a novel representation for the recognition of protein‚Äìprotein interaction sites that integrates enhanced relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predictions with high resolution structural data. An observation that RSA predictions are biased toward the level of surface exposure consistent with protein complexes led the authors to investigate the difference between the predicted and actual (i.e., observed in an unbound structure) RSA of an amino acid residue as a fingerprint of interaction sites. The authors demonstrate that RSA prediction‚Äêbased fingerprints of protein interactions significantly improve the discrimination between interacting and noninteracting sites, compared with evolutionary conservation, physicochemical characteristics, structure‚Äêderived and other features considered before. On the basis of these observations, the authors developed a new method for the prediction of protein‚Äìprotein interaction sites, using machine learning approaches to combine the most informative features into the final predictor. For training and validation, the authors used several large sets of protein complexes and derived from them nonredundant representative chains, with interaction sites mapped from multiple complexes. Alternative machine learning techniques are used, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, so as to evaluate the relative effects of the choice of a representation and a specific learning algorithm. The effects of induced fit and uncertainty of the negative (noninteracting) class assignment are also evaluated. Several representative methods from the literature are reimplemented to enable direct comparison of the results. Using rigorous validation protocols, the authors estimated that the new method yields the overall classification accuracy of about 74% and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.42, as opposed to up to 70% classification accuracy and up to 0.3 Matthews correlation coefficient for methods that do not utilize RSA prediction‚Äêbased fingerprints.

While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics.

First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning.
