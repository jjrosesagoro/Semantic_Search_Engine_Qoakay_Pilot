It is important that these sensors report accurate data in order to make accurate forecasts, as these forecasts are used extensively by Mn/DOT. Real time detection of sensor malfunctions can reduce the expense incurred in performing routine maintenance checks and re-calibrations of the sensors, while guaranteeing accurate data. In this work we predict RWIS sensor values using weather information from nearby RWIS sensors and other sensors from the AWOS network. Significant and/or systemic deviations from the predicted values are used to identify malfunctions. Based on historical data collected from the sensor and its nearby locations, we construct statistical models that can be used to predict current values. We use machine learning (ML) methods to build these models. We employ three types of ML models: classification algorithms, regression algorithms and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We use classification algorithms such as J48 decision trees, Naive Bayes and Bayesian Networks, regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Least Median Square (LMS), M5P regression trees, MultiLayer Perceptron, RBF Networks and Conjunctive Rule, and HMMs to predict the variables temperature, precipitation type and visibility. We selected a representative sample of the RWIS sites in Minnesota. We employed different representations of the data to try improve the model efficiency. To use temperature in regression algorithms and HMMs, we developed a method to discretize temperature. The Viterbi algorithm used in HMM was modified to obtain the symbol observed along the most probable path. From the results, we observed that LMS and M5P are highly accurate in predicting temperature and visibility. Predicting precipitation works well with J48 decision trees and",2012,32,49,2,True,Computer Science,2192265840,Ashok Srivastava,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrative analysis of multi-omics and clinical data is key to new biomedical discoveries and advancements in precision medicine. However, data integration poses new computational challenges as well as exacerbates the ones associated with single-omics studies. Specialized computational approaches are required to effectively and efficiently perform integrative analysis of biomedical data acquired from diverse modalities.

Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms.

Many machine learning methods such as linear regression or support vector machines rely on this representation. However, when the underlying data has strong relational patterns, especially relations with high cardinality, the design matrix can get very large which can make learning and prediction slow or even infeasible. This work solves this issue by making use of repeating patterns in the design matrix which stem from the underlying relational structure of the data. It is shown how coordinate descent learning and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference can be scaled for linear regression and factorization machine models. Empirically, it is shown on two large scale and very competitive datasets (Netflix prize, KDDCup 2012), that (1) standard learning algorithms based on the design matrix representation cannot scale to relational predictor variables, (2) the proposed new algorithms scale and (3) the predictive quality of the proposed generic feature-based approach is as good as the best specialized models that have been tailored to the respective tasks.",2013,24,101,7,True,Computer Science,2843982,Steffen Rendle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on part of the data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and the validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular CV methods: record-wise and subject-wise. While the subject-wise method mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosis in newly recruited subjects, the record-wise strategy has no such interpretation. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise CV often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method was used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning-based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as inaccurate results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.",2017,41,145,2,False,Computer Science,3059087,Sohrab Saeb,Medicine,3146304.0,L.

It succeeded to compute several performance metrics in order to evaluate the selected classifiers.

ICML is the annual conference of the lnternational Machine Learning Society (IMLS), and forms an international forum for the discussion and presentation of the latest results in the field of machine learning. This year, ICML was co-located with the 15th lnternational Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-2005), the proceedings of which are published by Springer Verlag in a separate volume. The papers in this volume were selected on the basis of a thorough review process. In the first round of reviewing, three program committee members produced individual reviews for a paper. Authors then had the opportunity to view those reviews and submit an author's reply to the reviewers. Led by the responsible area chair, the reviewers then engaged in a discussion about the paper, ultimately leading to the decision by the program chairs. In sum, of the 491 papers that were initially submitted, 62 were accepted immediately, and a further 81 were conditionally accepted and reconsidered after resubmission in a second round of reviewing. Of those 81 conditionally accepted papers, 72 were finally accepted, leading to a total of 134 accepted papers, which translates into an acceptance rate of 27.3 %. The author reply was a new feature of ICML this year, while the option of working with conditional accepts has already become a tradition. In addition to the presentations of the accepted papers, the ICML program included several other features. On the first and last day of the conference, 11 workshops and 6 tutorials on current topics of machine learning were held. For many of these, proceedings and/or presentation materials are available online from the ICML website. The other days of the conference each featured an invited talk by a prominent researcher as a program highlight. We were delighted that Johannes Gehrke of Cornell University, Michael Jordan of the University of California at Berkeley, and Gerhard Widmer of the University of Linz in Austria, agreed to deliver an invited talk. The abstracts of their talks are also published as part of these proceedings. Continuing a long standing tradition at ICML, all papers presented in a talk at the conference were also exhibited at evening poster sessions, giving everyone ample time to discuss the results in depth. In order to emphasize the co-location with ILP-2005, the program contained joint elements in both invited speakers, paper sessions, poster sessions, and tutorials. As usual, the scientific program was complemented by a social program, this time featuring an excursion to the scenic surroundings of the city of Bonn. During the conference best paper and best student paper awards were presented, the former being sponsored by NICTA, the later by the Machine Learning Journal.",2005,0,129,19,False,Computer Science,1693549,S.

Although a parallel ELM (PELM) based on MapReduce to process large-scale data shows more efficient learning speed than identical ELM algorithms in a serial environment, some operations, such as intermediate results stored on disks and multiple copies for each task, are indispensable, and these operations create a large amount of extra overhead and degrade the learning speed and efficiency of the PELMs. In this paper, an efficient ELM based on the Spark framework (SELM), which includes three parallel subalgorithms, is proposed for big data classification. By partitioning the corresponding data sets reasonably, the hidden layer output matrix calculation algorithm, matrix <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf {\hat {U}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> decomposition algorithm, and matrix <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf {V}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> decomposition algorithm perform most of the computations locally. At the same time, they retain the intermediate results in distributed memory and cache the diagonal matrix as broadcast variables instead of several copies for each task to reduce a large amount of the costs, and these actions strengthen the learning ability of the SELM. Finally, we implement our SELM algorithm to classify large data sets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. As shown, our SELM achieves an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$8.71\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup on a cluster with ten nodes, and reaches a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$13.79\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup with 15 nodes, an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$18.74\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup with 20 nodes, a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$23.79\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup with 25 nodes, a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$28.89\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup with 30 nodes, and a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$33.81\times$ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup with 35 nodes.",2018,35,104,3,False,Computer Science,48664471,Mingxing Duan,Medicine,145730774.0,Kenli Li,144078016.0,Xiangke Liao,2181606.0,Keqin Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although convex-concave saddle-point problems have been broadly studied with efficient algorithms and solid theories available, it remains a challenge to design provably efficient algorithms for non-convex saddle-point problems, especially when the objective function involves an expectation or a large-scale finite sum. Motivated by recent literature on non-convex non-smooth minimization, this paper studies a family of non-convex min-max problems where the minimization component is non-convex (weakly convex) and the maximization component is concave. We propose a proximally guided stochastic subgradient method and a proximally guided stochastic variance-reduced method for expected and finite-sum saddle-point problems, respectively.

The Minimum Descriptive Length (MDL) principle, a powerful method of inductive inference, holds that the best explanation, given a limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the greatest compression of the data -- that the more we are able to compress the data, the more we learn about the regularities underlying the data. Advances in Minimum Description Length is a sourcebook that will introduce the scientific community to the foundations of MDL, recent theoretical advances, and practical applications.The book begins with an extensive tutorial on MDL, covering its theoretical underpinnings, practical implications as well as its various interpretations, and its underlying philosophy. The tutorial includes a brief history of MDL -- from its roots in the notion of Kolmogorov complexity to the beginning of MDL proper. The book then presents recent theoretical advances, introducing modern MDL methods in a way that is accessible to readers from many different scientific fields.

For example, adjacency relationships, symmetries, and Cartesian coordinates are essential to any complete description of board games, visual recognition, or vehicle control. Yet many approaches to learning ignore such information in their representations, instead inputting flat parameter vectors with no indication of how those parameters are situated geometrically. This paper argues that such geometric information is critical to the ability of any machine learning approach to effectively generalize; even a small shift in the configuration of the task in space from what was experienced in training can go wholly unrecognized unless the algorithm is able to learn the regularities in decision-making across the problem geometry. To demonstrate the importance of learning from geometry, three variants of the same evolutionary learning algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), whose representations vary in their capacity to encode geometry, are compared in checkers. The result is that the variant that can learn geometric regularities produces a significantly more general solution. The conclusion is that it is important to enable machine learning to detect and thereby learn from the geometry of its problems.",2008,22,97,8,False,Computer Science,3351507,J.

RF waveforms represent a particular challenge because of the extremely high data rates involved and the potentially large number of transmitters sharing a channel in a given location. These factors outline the need for rapid fingerprinting and identification methods that go beyond the traditional hand-engineered approaches. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learning strategies to the classification and identification problem. We evaluate four different strategies: conventional deep neural nets, convolutional neural nets, support vector machines, and deep neural nets with multi-stage training. The latter was by far the most accurate, achieving 100% classification accuracy of 12 transmitters, and showing remarkable potential for scalability to large transmitter populations.",2017,68,82,3,True,Computer Science,47226368,K.

It will be shown that the data-driven approaches should not replace, but rather complement, traditional design techniques based on mathematical models. Extensive motivation is given for why deep learning based on artificial neural networks will be an indispensable tool for the design and operation of future wireless communication networks, and our vision of how artificial neural networks should be integrated into the architecture of future wireless communication networks is presented. A thorough description of deep learning methodologies is provided, starting with the general machine learning paradigm, followed by a more in-depth discussion about deep learning and artificial neural networks, covering the most widely used artificial neural network architectures and their training methods. Deep learning will also be connected to other major learning frameworks, such as reinforcement learning and transfer learning. A thorough survey of the literature on deep learning for wireless communication networks is provided, followed by a detailed description of several novel case studies wherein the use of deep learning proves extremely useful for network design. For each case study, it will be shown how the use of (even approximate) mathematical models can significantly reduce the amount of live data that needs to be acquired/measured to implement the data-driven approaches.

Recent frameworks address this bottleneck with generative models to synthesize labels at scale from weak supervision sources. The generative model's dependency structure directly affects the quality of the estimated labels, but selecting a structure automatically without any labeled data is a distinct challenge. We propose a structure estimation method that maximizes the ℓ 1-regularized marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data. Our analysis shows that the amount of unlabeled data required to identify the true structure scales sublinearly in the number of possible dependencies for a broad class of models. Simulations show that our method is 100× faster than a maximum likelihood approach and selects 1/4 as many extraneous dependencies. We also show that our method provides an average of 1.5 F1 points of improvement over existing, user-developed information extraction applications on real-world data such as PubMed journal abstracts.",2017,39,122,10,False,Computer Science,2870504,Stephen H.

Results of word2vec play an important role in word alignment of the input vectors. RNN structure is very complicated and to train the large data file on word2vec is also a time-consuming task.

Albeit its popularity, it has been observed that FL yields suboptimal results if the local clients’ data distributions diverge. To address this issue, we present clustered FL (CFL), a novel federated multitask learning (FMTL) framework, which exploits geometric properties of the FL loss surface to group the client population into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. In contrast to existing FMTL approaches, CFL does not require any modifications to the FL communication protocol to be made, is applicable to general nonconvex objectives (in particular, deep neural networks), does not require the number of clusters to be known a priori, and comes with strong mathematical guarantees on the clustering quality. CFL is flexible enough to handle client populations that vary over time and can be implemented in a privacy-preserving way. As clustering is only performed after FL has converged to a stationary point, CFL can be viewed as a postprocessing method that will always achieve greater or equal performance than conventional FL by allowing clients to arrive at more specialized models. We verify our theoretical analysis in experiments with deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks on commonly used FL data sets.",2019,43,267,42,True,Computer Science,46223357,Felix Sattler,Medicine,145034054.0,K.

The CSP method is a supervised algorithm and therefore needs subject-specific training data for calibration, which is very time consuming to collect. In order to reduce the amount of calibration data that is needed for a new subject, one can apply multitask (from now on called multisubject) machine learning techniques to the preprocessing phase. Here, the goal of multisubject learning is to learn a spatial filter for a new subject based on its own data and that of other subjects.

Variational inference (VI) lets us approximate a high-dimensional Bayesian posterior with a simpler variational distribution by solving an optimization problem. This approach has been successfully applied to various models and large-scale applications. In this review, we give an overview of recent trends in variational inference. We first introduce standard mean field variational inference, then review recent advances focusing on the following aspects: (a) scalable VI, which includes stochastic approximations, (b) generic VI, which extends the applicability of VI to a large class of otherwise intractable models, such as non-conjugate models, (c) accurate VI, which includes variational models beyond the mean field approximation or with atypical divergences, and (d) amortized VI, which implements the inference over local latent variables with inference networks.

Due to the low sampling rate of quality variables, most of the soft sensors are developed on small number of labeled samples and the large number of unlabeled process data is discarded. The loss of information greatly limits the improvement of quality prediction accuracy. One of the main issues of data-driven soft sensor is to furthest exploit the information contained in all available process data. This paper proposes a semisupervised deep learning model for soft sensor development based on the hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM). First, the deep network structure of autoencoders is implemented for unsupervised feature extraction with all the process samples. Then, extreme learning machine is utilized for regression through appending the quality variable. Meanwhile, the manifold regularization method is introduced for semisupervised model training. The new method can not only deeply extract the information that the data contains, but learn more from the extra unlabeled samples as well. The proposed semisupervised HELM method is applied in a high–low transformer to estimate the carbon monoxide content, which shows a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy, compared to traditional methods.",2018,26,173,5,False,Engineering,48028582,Le Yao,Computer Science,145619185.0,Zhiqiang Ge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good teacher not only provides his/her students with qualified teaching materials (e.g., textbooks), but also sets up appropriate learning objectives (e.g., course projects and exams) considering different situations of a student. When it comes to artificial intelligence, treating machine learning models as students, the loss functions that are optimized act as perfect counterparts of the learning objective set by the teacher. In this work, we explore the possibility of imitating human teaching behaviors by dynamically and automatically outputting appropriate loss functions to train machine learning models. Different from typical learning settings in which the loss function of a machine learning model is predefined and fixed, in our framework, the loss function of a machine learning model (we call it student) is defined by another machine learning model (we call it teacher). The ultimate goal of teacher model is cultivating the student to have better performance measured on development dataset. Towards that end, similar to human teaching, the teacher, a parametric model, dynamically outputs different loss functions that will be used and optimized by its student model at different training stages. We develop an efficient learning method for the teacher model that makes gradient based optimization possible, exempt of the ineffective solutions such as policy optimization. We name our method as ""learning to teach with dynamic loss functions"" (L2T-DLF for short). Extensive experiments on real world tasks including image classification and neural machine translation demonstrate that our method significantly improves the quality of various student models.",2018,62,76,13,False,Computer Science,47767550,Lijun Wu,Mathematics,143853336.0,Fei Tian,2794096.0,Yingce Xia,144566102.0,Yang Fan,143826491.0,Tao Qin,66117656.0,J.

Recent advances in statistical learning theory have led to the application of support vector machines to MRI for detection of a variety of disease states. The aims of this study were to assess how successfully support vector machines assigned individual diagnoses and to determine whether data-sets combined from multiple scanners and different centres could be used to obtain effective classification of scans. We used linear support vector machines to classify the grey matter segment of T1-weighted MR scans from pathologically proven AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals obtained from two centres with different scanning equipment. Because the clinical diagnosis of mild AD is difficult we also tested the ability of support vector machines to differentiate control scans from patients without post-mortem confirmation. Finally we sought to use these methods to differentiate scans between patients suffering from AD from those with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Up to 96% of pathologically verified AD patients were correctly classified using whole brain images. Data from different centres were successfully combined achieving comparable results from the separate analyses. Importantly, data from one centre could be used to train a support vector machine to accurately differentiate AD and normal ageing scans obtained from another centre with different subjects and different scanner equipment. Patients with mild, clinically probable AD and age/sex matched controls were correctly separated in 89% of cases which is compatible with published diagnosis rates in the best clinical centres. This method correctly assigned 89% of patients with post-mortem confirmed diagnosis of either AD or frontotemporal lobar degeneration to their respective group. Our study leads to three conclusions: Firstly, support vector machines successfully separate patients with AD from healthy aging subjects. Secondly, they perform well in the differential diagnosis of two different forms of dementia. Thirdly, the method is robust and can be generalized across different centres. This suggests an important role for computer based diagnostic image analysis for clinical practice.",2008,54,1087,87,True,Psychology,144225920,S. Klöppel,Medicine,2609123.0,C.

The task is even more difficult when practical circumstances require that evaluation be done automatically over short texts, for instance, during incremental system development and error analysis. While several automatic metrics, such as BLEU, have been proposed and adopted for largescale MT system discrimination, they all fail to achieve satisfactory levels of correlation with human judgments at the sentence level. Here, a new class of metrics based on machine learning is introduced. A novel method involving classifying translations as machine or humanproduced rather than directly predicting numerical human judgments eliminates the need for labor-intensive user studies as a source of training data. The resulting metric, based on support vector machines, is shown to significantly improve upon current automatic metrics, increasing correlation with human judgments at the sentence level halfway toward that achieved by an independent human evaluator.",2004,14,113,8,False,Computer Science,145500336,Alex Kulesza,,1692491.0,S.

The results of the machine-learning approaches suggest a link between the MODIS AOD biases and surface type.

Recently, pixel/voxel-based ML (PML) emerged in medical image processing/analysis, which use pixel/voxel values in images directly instead of features calculated from segmented objects as input information; thus, feature calculation or segmentation is not required. Because the PML can avoid errors caused by inaccurate feature calculation and segmentation which often occur for subtle or complex objects, the performance of the PML can potentially be higher for such objects than that of common classifiers (i.e., feature-based MLs). In this paper, PMLs are surveyed to make clear (a) classes of PMLs, (b) similarities and differences within (among) different PMLs and those between PMLs and feature-based MLs, (c) advantages and limitations of PMLs, and (d) their applications in medical imaging.",2012,119,82,3,True,Computer Science,2118855751,Kenji Suzuki,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a model-based fault diagnostics system developed using a machine learning technology for detecting and locating multiple classes of faults in an electric drive. Power electronics inverter can be considered to be the weakest link in such a system from hardware failure point of view; hence, this work is focused on detecting faults and finding which switches in the inverter cause the faults. A simulation model has been developed based on the theoretical foundations of electric drives to simulate the normal condition, all single-switch and post-short-circuit faults. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, fault diagnostic neural network (FDNN). We validated the capability of the FDNN on data generated by an experimental bench setup.

However, current distributed DL implementations can scale poorly due to substantial parameter synchronization over the network, because the high throughput of GPUs allows more data batches to be processed per unit time than CPUs, leading to more frequent network synchronization. We present Poseidon, an efficient communication architecture for distributed DL on GPUs. Poseidon exploits the layered model structures in DL programs to overlap communication and computation, reducing bursty network communication. Moreover, Poseidon uses a hybrid communication scheme that optimizes the number of bytes required to synchronize each layer, according to layer properties and the number of machines. We show that Poseidon is applicable to different DL frameworks by plugging Poseidon into Caffe and TensorFlow. We show that Poseidon enables Caffe and TensorFlow to achieve 15.5x speed-up on 16 single-GPU machines, even with limited bandwidth (10GbE) and the challenging VGG19-22K network for image classification. Moreover, Poseidon-enabled TensorFlow achieves 31.5x speed-up with 32 single-GPU machines on Inception-V3, a 50% improvement over the open-source TensorFlow (20x speed-up).",2017,37,253,29,False,Computer Science,1682058,H.

This article maps the principal forms of material action, narrative and problematization that run across algorithmic modelling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and Naive Bayes classifiers. It highlights several interlinked modes of generalization that engender increasingly vast data infrastructures and platforms, and intensified mathematical and statistical treatments of differences. Such an account also points to some key sites of instability or problematization inherent to the process of generalization.

To address this, we propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions, which help decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL. Theoretically, we show that pFedMe's convergence rate is state-of-the-art: achieving quadratic speedup for strongly convex and sublinear speedup of order 2/3 for smooth nonconvex objectives.

Materials and Methods: Data were from a health system’s EHR on 3884 incident HF cases and 28 903 controls, identified as primary care patients, between May 16, 2000, and May 23, 2013. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models using gated recurrent units (GRUs) were adapted to detect relations among time-stamped events (eg, disease diagnosis, medication orders, procedure orders, etc.) with a 12- to 18-month observation window of cases and controls. Model performance metrics were compared to regularized logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor classifier approaches. Results: Using a 12-month observation window, the area under the curve (AUC) for the RNN model was 0.777, compared to AUCs for logistic regression (0.747), multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer (0.765), support vector machine (SVM) (0.743), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) (0.730). When using an 18-month observation window, the AUC for the RNN model increased to 0.883 and was significantly higher than the 0.834 AUC for the best of the baseline methods (MLP). Conclusion: Deep learning models adapted to leverage temporal relations appear to improve performance of models for detection of incident heart failure with a short observation window of 12–18 months.",2016,63,568,23,True,Computer Science,3242613,E.

This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumoris a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses thestate-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross tota lresection. Finally, we investigate the challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks, considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge, the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously evolving/growing dataset.",2018,109,904,52,False,Computer Science,3199900,S.

Although randomized control trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for testing and introducing new drugs, due to the focus on specific questions with respect to establishing efficacy and safety vs. standard treatment, they do not provide a full characterization of the heterogeneity in the final intended treatment population. Conversely, real‐world observational data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), contain large amounts of clinical information about heterogeneous patients and their response to treatments. In this paper, we introduce the main opportunities and challenges in using observational data for training machine learning methods to estimate individualized treatment effects and make treatment recommendations. We describe the modeling choices of the state‐of‐the‐art machine learning methods for causal inference, developed for estimating treatment effects both in the cross‐section and longitudinal settings. Additionally, we highlight future research directions that could lead to achieving the full potential of leveraging EHRs and machine learning for making individualized treatment recommendations. We also discuss how experimental data from RCTs and Pharmacometric and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approaches can be used to not only improve machine learning methods, but also provide ways for validating them. These future research directions will require us to collaborate across the scientific disciplines to incorporate models based on RCTs and known disease processes, physiology, and pharmacology into these machine learning models based on EHRs to fully optimize the opportunity these data present.",2020,117,75,1,True,Computer Science,1751623812,I.

One advantage to a machine-learning approach is that correlations in defined features disentangle relationships among the various structural parameters. For example, in Au25, we find that features based on the distribution of Ag atoms relative to the CO adsorption site are the most important in predicting adsorption energies.

Although a number of semi-supervised methods have been proposed, their effectiveness on NLP tasks is not always clear. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning paradigm which we call structural learning. The idea is to find ""what good classifiers are like"" by learning from thousands of automatically generated auxiliary classification problems on unlabeled data. By doing so, the common predictive structure shared by the multiple classification problems can be discovered, which can then be used to improve performance on the target problem.

However, experimentally identifying compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is generally expensive and time-consuming, computational approaches are thus introduced.

However, due to the nonlinear and imbalanced nature of biological data, many machine learning approaches have their own limitations. Recently, deep learning techniques show advantages over many state-of-the-art machine learning methods in many applications. In this study, we aim at improving the performance of CPI prediction based on deep learning, and propose a method called DL-CPI (the abbreviation of Deep Learning for Compound-Protein Interactions prediction), which employs deep neural network (DNN) to effectively learn the representations of compound-protein pairs.

Spammers send unwanted tweets to Twitter users to promote websites or services, which are harmful to normal users. In order to stop spammers, researchers have proposed a number of mechanisms. The focus of recent works is on the application of machine learning techniques into Twitter spam detection. However, tweets are retrieved in a streaming way, and Twitter provides the Streaming API for developers and researchers to access public tweets in real time. There lacks a performance evaluation of existing machine learning-based streaming spam detection methods. In this paper, we bridged the gap by carrying out a performance evaluation, which was from three different aspects of data, feature, and model. A big ground-truth of over 600 million public tweets was created by using a commercial URL-based security tool. For real-time spam detection, we further extracted 12 lightweight features for tweet representation. Spam detection was then transformed to a binary classification problem in the feature space and can be solved by conventional machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the impact of different factors to the spam detection performance, which included spam to nonspam ratio, feature discretization, training data size, data sampling, time-related data, and machine learning algorithms.

The standard algorithm for this task, known as the Swap Test, is used in many applications such as quantum support vector machines, and, when specialized to ρ = σ, quantifies the Renyi entanglement. Here, we find algorithms that have shorter depths than the Swap Test, including one that has a constant depth (independent of problem size).

This task is commonly referred to as requirements prioritization. This paper describes a requirements prioritization method called Case-Based Ranking (CBRank), which combines project's stakeholders preferences with requirements ordering approximations computed through machine learning techniques, bringing promising advantages. First, the human effort to input preference information can be reduced, while preserving the accuracy of the final ranking estimates. Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process. The techniques CBRank rests on and the associated prioritization process are detailed. Empirical evaluations of properties of CBRank are performed on simulated data and compared with a state-of-the-art prioritization method, providing evidence of the method ability to support the management of the tradeoff between elicitation effort and ranking accuracy and to exploit domain knowledge. A case study on a real software project complements these experimental measurements.

The technique uses a limited time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a ""reservoir."" After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the ""output weights."" The learned output weights are then used to form a modified autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing an arbitrarily long time series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's ""climate."" Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can compute the derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. In the case of the KS equation, we note that the high dimensional nature of the system and the large number of Lyapunov exponents yield a challenging test of our method, which we find the method successfully passes.",2017,25,341,14,True,Computer Science,35620505,Jaideep Pathak,Physics,34949672.0,Zhixin Lu,1868698.0,B.

Therefore, it is essential to broaden the sensitivity of the search program to include unexpected scenarios. We present a new model-agnostic anomaly detection technique that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms. The only requirement on the signal for this new procedure is that it is localized in at least one known direction in phase space. Any other directions of phase space that are uncorrelated with the localized one can be used to search for unexpected features. This new method is applied to the dijet resonance search to show that it can turn a modest 2σ excess into a 7σ excess for a model with an intermediate BSM particle that is not currently targeted by a dedicated search.",2018,85,125,1,True,Physics,153639309,J.

As a recent example, researchers have shown that popular word embedding algorithms exhibit stereotypical biases, such as gender bias. The widespread use of these algorithms in machine learning systems, from automated translation services to curriculum vitae scanners, can amplify stereotypes in important contexts. Although methods have been developed to measure these biases and alter word embeddings to mitigate their biased representations, there is a lack of understanding in how word embedding bias depends on the training data. In this work, we develop a technique for understanding the origins of bias in word embeddings. Given a word embedding trained on a corpus, our method identifies how perturbing the corpus will affect the bias of the resulting embedding. This can be used to trace the origins of word embedding bias back to the original training documents. Using our method, one can investigate trends in the bias of the underlying corpus and identify subsets of documents whose removal would most reduce bias. We demonstrate our techniques on both a New York Times and Wikipedia corpus and find that our influence function-based approximations are very accurate.",2018,25,116,9,False,Mathematics,16233775,Marc-Etienne Brunet,Computer Science,1411418984.0,Colleen Alkalay-Houlihan,32071555.0,Ashton Anderson,1804104.0,R.

A major obstacle to supporting these predictive applications is the challenging and expensive process of identifying and training an appropriate predictive model. Recent efforts aiming to automate this process have focused on single node implementations and have assumed that model training itself is a black box, limiting their usefulness for applications driven by large-scale datasets. In this work, we build upon these recent efforts and propose an architecture for automatic machine learning at scale comprised of a cost-based cluster resource allocation estimator, advanced hyper-parameter tuning techniques, bandit resource allocation via runtime algorithm introspection, and physical optimization via batching and optimal resource allocation. The result is TuPAQ, a component of the MLbase system that automatically finds and trains models for a user's predictive application with comparable quality to those found using exhaustive strategies, but an order of magnitude more efficiently than the standard baseline approach.

Classical and quantum information patterns of the target datasets therefore provide principled guidelines for structural design and learning in these two approaches. Taking the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) as an example, we analyze the information theoretical bounds of the two approaches. We also estimate the classical mutual information of the standard MNIST datasets and the quantum Rényi entropy of corresponding Matrix Product States (MPS) representations. Both information measures are much smaller compared to their theoretical upper bound and exhibit similar patterns, which imply a common inductive bias of low information complexity.

Although there are established screening methods - fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography for detection of the disease but in majority of the cases, the patients remain ignorant and fail to undertake such tests at an appropriate time. The early detection of the disease plays an extremely important role in preventing vision loss which is the consequence of diabetes mellitus remaining untreated among patients for a prolonged time period. Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been implemented on diabetic retinopathy dataset for classification and prediction of the disease but majority of them have neglected the aspect of data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction, leading to biased results. The dataset used in the present study is a diabetes retinopathy dataset collected from the UCI machine learning repository. At its inceptions, the raw dataset is normalized using the Standardscalar technique and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most significant features in the dataset. Further, Firefly algorithm is implemented for dimensionality reduction. This reduced dataset is fed into a Deep Neural Network Model for classification.

However, some pundits are predicting that the final damage will be even worse. Accompanying ICML 2015 in Lille, France, there was another, almost as big, event: the 2015 Deep Learning Workshop. The workshop ended with a panel discussion, and at it, Neil Lawrence said, “NLP is kind of like a rabbit in the headlights of the Deep Learning machine, waiting to be flattened.” Now that is a remark that the computational linguistics community has to take seriously! Is it the end of the road for us? Where are these predictions of steamrollering coming from? At the June 2015 opening of the Facebook AI Research Lab in Paris, its director Yann LeCun said: “The next big step for Deep Learning is natural language understanding, which aims to give machines the power to understand not just individual words but entire sentences and paragraphs.”1 In a November 2014 Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), Geoff Hinton said, “I think that the most exciting areas over the next five years will be really understanding text and videos. I will be disappointed if in five years’ time we do not have something that can watch a YouTube video and tell a story about what happened. In a few years time we will put [Deep Learning] on a chip that fits into someone’s ear and have an English-decoding chip that’s just like a real Babel fish.”2 And Yoshua Bengio, the third giant of modern Deep Learning, has also increasingly oriented his group’s research toward language, including recent exciting new developments in neural machine translation systems. It’s not just Deep Learning researchers. When leading machine learning researcher Michael Jordan was asked at a September 2014 AMA, “If you got a billion dollars to spend on a huge research project that you get to lead, what would you like to do?”, he answered: “I’d use the billion dollars to build a NASA-size program focusing on natural language processing, in all of its glory (semantics, pragmatics, etc.).” He went on: “Intellectually I think that NLP is fascinating, allowing us to focus on highly structured inference problems, on issues that go to the core of ‘what is thought’ but remain eminently practical, and on a technology",2015,16,177,14,False,History,144783904,Christopher D.

We train our machine-learning algorithm using accurate, correlated quantum chemistry, and predict energies and forces in molecular aggregates ranging from clusters to solid and liquid phases. The widely used electronic-structure methods based on density functional theory (DFT) by themselves give poor accuracy for molecular materials like water, and we show how our techniques can be used to generate systematically improvable one- and two-body corrections to DFT with modest extra resources. The resulting corrected DFT scheme is considerably more accurate than uncorrected DFT for the relative energies of small water clusters and different ice structures and significantly improves the description of the structure and dynamics of liquid water. However, our results for ice structures and the liquid indicate that beyond-two-body DFT errors cannot be ignored, and we suggest how our machine-learning methods can be further developed to correct these errors.",2013,91,148,2,False,Physics,3938091,A.

On the one hand, a part of the community defends that black-box models are more accurate than explainable models in some contexts, like image preprocessing. On the other hand, there exist another part of the community alleging that explainable models are better than black-box models because they can obtain comparable results and also they can explain these results in a language close to a human expert by using patterns. In this paper, advantages and weaknesses for each approach are shown; taking into account a state-of-the-art review for both approaches, their practical applications, trends, and future challenges. This paper shows that both approaches are suitable for solving practical problems, but experts in machine learning need to understand the input data, the problem to solve, and the best way for showing the output data before applying a machine learning model. Also, we propose some ideas for fusing both, explainable and black-box, approaches to provide better solutions to experts in real-world domains. Additionally, we show one way to measure the effectiveness of the applied machine learning model by using expert opinions jointly with statistical methods. Throughout this paper, we show the impact of using explainable and black-box models on the security and medical applications.",2019,167,119,2,False,Computer Science,1390024239,O.

Modern parallelization strategies employ fine-grained operations and scheduling beyond the classic bulk-synchronous processing paradigm popularized by MapReduce, or even specialized graph-based execution that relies on graph representations of ML programs. The variety of approaches tends to pull systems and algorithms design in different directions, and it remains difficult to find a universal platform applicable to a wide range of ML programs at scale. We propose a general-purpose framework, Petuum, that systematically addresses data- and model-parallel challenges in large-scale ML, by observing that many ML programs are fundamentally optimization-centric and admit error-tolerant, iterative-convergent algorithmic solutions. This presents unique opportunities for an integrative system design, such as bounded-error network synchronization and dynamic scheduling based on ML program structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of these system designs versus well-known implementations of modern ML algorithms, showing that Petuum allows ML programs to run in much less time and at considerably larger model sizes, even on modestly-sized compute clusters.",2013,74,468,48,True,Computer Science,143977260,E.

On the other hand, state-of-the-art information retrieval systems are quite brittle--they traditionally represent documents as bags of words, and are restricted to learning from individual word occurrences in the (necessarily limited) training set. For instance, given the sentence ""Wal-Mart supply chain goes real time"", how can a text categorization system know that Wal-Mart manages its stock with RFID technology? And having read that ""Ciprofloxacin belongs to the quinolones group"", how on earth can a machine know that the drug mentioned is an antibiotic produced by Bayer? In this paper we present algorithms that can do just that. We propose to enrich document representation through automatic use of a vast compendium of human knowledge--an encyclopedia. We apply machine learning techniques to Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia to date, which surpasses in scope many conventional encyclopedias and provides a cornucopia of world knowledge. Each Wikipedia article represents a concept, and documents to be categorized are represented in the rich feature space of words and relevant Wikipedia concepts.

Particularly, we applied the machine learning method to analyze an eye movement dataset from a face recognition task [Yi et al., 2016], to classify children with and without ASD. We evaluated the performance of our model in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classifying ASD. Results indicated promising evidence for applying the machine learning algorithm based on the face scanning patterns to identify children with ASD, with a maximum classification accuracy of 88.51%. Nevertheless, our study is still preliminary with some constraints that may apply in the clinical practice.

In particular, they can identify patient cases that would benefit most from a medical second opinion. Our central methodological finding is that Direct Uncertainty Prediction (DUP), training a model to predict an uncertainty score directly from the raw patient features, works better than Uncertainty Via Classification, the two-step process of training a classifier and postprocessing the output distribution to give an uncertainty score.

Singular values and vectors form the selected features for visual quality assessment. Machine learning is then used for the feature pooling process and demonstrated to be effective. This is to address the limitations of the existing pooling techniques, like simple summation, averaging, Minkowski summation, etc., which tend to be ad hoc. We advocate machine learning for feature pooling because it is more systematic and data driven. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the eight existing relevant schemes. Extensive analysis and cross validation are performed with ten publicly available databases (eight for images with a total of 4042 test images and two for video with a total of 228 videos). We use all publicly accessible software and databases in this study, as well as making our own software public, to facilitate comparison in future research.",2012,72,140,9,False,Computer Science,1758088,Manish Narwaria,Medicine,144968898.0,Weisi Lin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example it may be a legal requirement that a decision must not favour a particular group. Alternatively it can be that that representation of data must not have identifying information. We address these two related issues by learning flexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic. This adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the representation, and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures there is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive variable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making decisions free from discrimination and removing private information from images. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem, and optimize that minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer. We demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for standard test problems, and compare with previous state of the art methods for fairness, showing statistically significant improvement across most cases. The flexibility of this method is shown via a novel problem: removing annotations from images, from unaligned training examples of annotated and unannotated images, and with no a priori knowledge of the form of annotation provided to the model.",2015,29,396,50,False,Computer Science,144632352,Harrison Edwards,Mathematics,1728216.0,A.

Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, considering the noise, varying length and irregular sampling behind sensory data, this kind of sequential data cannot be fed into classification and regression models directly. Therefore, previous work focuses on feature extraction/fusion methods requiring expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, which redefine representation learning from raw data, a deep neural network structure named Convolutional Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CBLSTM) has been designed here to address raw sensory data. CBLSTM firstly uses CNN to extract local features that are robust and informative from the sequential input. Then, bi-directional LSTM is introduced to encode temporal information. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data, and the bi-directional structure enables the capture of past and future contexts. Stacked, fully-connected layers and the linear regression layer are built on top of bi-directional LSTMs to predict the target value. Here, a real-life tool wear test is introduced, and our proposed CBLSTM is able to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data. The experimental results have shown that our model is able to outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods.",2017,56,435,18,True,Computer Science,49832912,Rui Zhao,Engineering,35374692.0,Ruqiang Yan,49605588.0,Jinjiang Wang,144067957.0,K.
