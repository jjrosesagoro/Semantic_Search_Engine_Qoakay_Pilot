In this approach, machine learning algorithms are used to classify measurements as being either secure or attacked. An attack detection framework is provided to exploit any available prior knowledge about the system and surmount constraints arising from the sparse structure of the problem in the proposed approach. Well-known batch and online learning algorithms (supervised and semisupervised) are employed with decision- and feature-level fusion to model the attack detection problem. The relationships between statistical and geometric properties of attack vectors employed in the attack scenarios and learning algorithms are analyzed to detect unobservable attacks using statistical learning methods. The proposed algorithms are examined on various IEEE test systems. Experimental analyses show that machine learning algorithms can detect attacks with performances higher than attack detection algorithms that employ state vector estimation methods in the proposed attack detection framework.",2015,82,352,26,True,Computer Science,Medicine,2159942,M.

Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.",2016,53,5113,388,False,Computer Science,,48607963,Yonghui Wu,144927151.0,M.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called “health factors,” or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.",2015,31,446,14,True,Engineering,Computer Science,3126083,Gian Antonio Susto,2979820.0,A.

However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.",2015,56,5307,952,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,2681954,Y.

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6% to 93.2% and from 88.0% to 93.8% on Omniglot compared to competing approaches.

Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space.

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.",2008,112,1713,182,True,Computer Science,Medicine,1721991,E.

Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed.

Until recently, this progress has been fueled mostly by advances in machine learning; however, more and more researchers are realizing the importance of studying users of these systems. In this article we promote this approach and demonstrate how it can result in better user experiences and more effective learning systems. We present a number of case studies that characterize the impact of interactivity, demonstrate ways in which some existing systems fail to account for the user, and explore new ways for learning systems to interact with their users. We argue that the design process for interactive machine learning systems should involve users at all stages: explorations that reveal human interaction patterns and inspire novel interaction methods, as well as refinement stages to tune details of the interface and choose among alternatives.

Although general-purpose CPUs and GPUs have provided straightforward solutions, their energy-efficiencies are limited due to their excessive supports for flexibility. Hardware accelerators may achieve better energy-efficiencies, but each accelerator often accommodates only a single ML technique (family). According to the famous No-Free-Lunch theorem in the ML domain, however, an ML technique performs well on a dataset may perform poorly on another dataset, which implies that such accelerator may sometimes lead to poor learning accuracy. Even if regardless of the learning accuracy, such accelerator can still become inapplicable simply because the concrete ML task is altered, or the user chooses another ML technique. In this study, we present an ML accelerator called PuDianNao, which accommodates seven representative ML techniques, including k-means, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, support vector machine, linear regression, classification tree, and deep neural network. Benefited from our thorough analysis on computational primitives and locality properties of different ML techniques, PuDianNao can perform up to 1056 GOP/s (e.g., additions and multiplications) in an area of 3.51 mm^2, and consumes 596 mW only.

However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via ℓ1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.",2016,35,989,93,False,Computer Science,Medicine,2967405,Jiexiong Tang,7175017.0,Chenwei Deng,145678691.0,G.

It discusses the system challenges presented by the Big Data problems associated with network intrusion prediction. The prediction of a possible intrusion attack in a network requires continuous collection of traffic data and learning of their characteristics on the fly. The continuous collection of traffic data by the network leads to Big Data problems that are caused by the volume, variety and velocity properties of Big Data. The learning of the network characteristics require machine learning techniques that capture global knowledge of the traffic patterns. The Big Data properties will lead to significant system challenges to implement machine learning frameworks. This paper discusses the problems and challenges in handling Big Data classification using geometric representation-learning techniques and the modern Big Data networking technologies.

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

Using our transfer learning method we improve baseline NMT models by an average of 5.6 Bleu on four low-resource language pairs. Ensembling and unknown word replacement add another 2 Bleu which brings the NMT performance on low-resource machine translation close to a strong syntax based machine translation (SBMT) system, exceeding its performance on one language pair.

This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns. 1 Machine Learning and Complex Systems Real world software engineers are often faced with the challenge of moving quickly to ship new products or services, which can lead to a dilemma between speed of execution and quality of engineering. The concept of technical debt was first introduced by Ward Cunningham in 1992 as a way to help quantify the cost of such decisions. Like incurring fiscal debt, there are often sound strategic reasons to take on technical debt. Not all debt is necessarily bad, but technical debt does tend to compound. Deferring the work to pay it off results in increasing costs, system brittleness, and reduced rates of innovation. Traditional methods of paying off technical debt include refactoring, increasing coverage of unit tests, deleting dead code, reducing dependencies, tightening APIs, and improving documentation [4]. The goal of these activities is not to add new functionality, but to make it easier to add future improvements, be cheaper to maintain, and reduce the likelihood of bugs. One of the basic arguments in this paper is that machine learning packages have all the basic code complexity issues as normal code, but also have a larger system-level complexity that can create hidden debt. Thus, refactoring these libraries, adding better unit tests, and associated activity is time well spent but does not necessarily address debt at a systems level. In this paper, we focus on the system-level interaction between machine learning code and larger systems as an area where hidden technical debt may rapidly accumulate. At a system-level, a machine learning model may subtly erode abstraction boundaries. It may be tempting to re-use input signals in ways that create unintended tight coupling of otherwise disjoint systems. Machine learning packages may often be treated as black boxes, resulting in large masses of “glue code” or calibration layers that can lock in assumptions. Changes in the external world may make models or input signals change behavior in unintended ways, ratcheting up maintenance cost and the burden of any debt. Even monitoring that the system as a whole is operating as intended may be difficult without careful design.",2014,10,259,10,False,Business,,1733143,D. Sculley,144510728.0,Gary Holt,145973657.0,D.

However, human labeling is very costly. To tackle this training data bottleneck, we develop a dual-learning mechanism, which can enable an NMT system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game. This mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine translation task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal) versus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form a closed loop, and generate informative feedback signals to train the translation models, even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the dual-learning mechanism, we use one agent to represent the model for the primal task and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task, then ask them to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the feedback signals generated during this process (e.g., the language-model likelihood of the output of a model, and the reconstruction error of the original sentence after the primal and dual translations), we can iteratively update the two models until convergence (e.g., using the policy gradient methods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation dual-NMT. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on English ↔ French translation; especially, by learning from monolingual data (with 10% bilingual data for warm start), it achieves a comparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the French-to-English translation task.",2016,18,681,54,False,Computer Science,,1391126980,Di He,2794096.0,Yingce Xia,143826491.0,Tao Qin,24952249.0,Liwei Wang,1708598.0,Nenghai Yu,,2110264337.0,Tie-Yan Liu,1712167.0,Wei-Ying Ma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to the substantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong data consistency guarantees. We develop graph based extensions to pipelined locking and data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect of network latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstraction using the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it can be easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself.

Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications.

Social media is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters that are allowed in Twitter is 140. Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products.",2013,18,316,9,False,Computer Science,,9388856,M. Neethu,144357907.0,R.

For application to large databases, filters have proven to be more practical than wrappers because they are much faster. However, most existing filter algorithms only work with discrete classification problems. This paper describes a fast, correlation-based filter algorithm that can be applied to continuous and discrete problems. The algorithm often outperforms the well-known ReliefF attribute estimator when used as a preprocessing step for naive Bayes, instance-based learning, decision trees, locally weighted regression, and model trees. It performs more feature selection than ReliefF does—reducing the data dimensionality by fifty percent in most cases. Also, decision and model trees built from the preprocessed data are often significantly smaller.",1999,27,1887,221,False,Computer Science,,118860642,M.

Here, we explain how machine-learning methods work and what needs to be considered for their successful application in cell biology. We outline how microscopy images can be converted into a data representation suitable for machine learning, and then introduce various state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms, highlighting recent applications in image-based screening.

To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.",2013,36,168,12,True,Computer Science,Medicine,1792884,Charles M.
