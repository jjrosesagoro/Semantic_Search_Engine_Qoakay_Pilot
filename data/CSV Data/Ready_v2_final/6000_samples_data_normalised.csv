The hybrid SVM/HMM system has been developed based on our public domain toolkit. The hybrid system has been evaluated on the OGI Alphadigits corpus and performs at 11.6% WER, as compared to 12.7% with a triphone mixture-Gaussian HMM system, while using only a fifth of the training data used by triphone system.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.",2017,166,214,6,True,Computer Science,2061099244,A.

The proposed models adopt supervised learning without modifying the basic learning algorithm. They behave as a supervised learning machine, which can learn input-output functions in addition to the characteristics of the conventional Kohonen feature maps. In the pattern recognition problems, the proposed models can structure the recognition system more simply than the conventional method, i.e., structuring a pattern recognition machine using a supervised learning machine after pre-processing by the Kohonen feature map. The proposed models do not distinguish the input vectors from the desired vectors because they regard them as the same kind of vectors. Several examples are simulated in order to compare with the conventional supervised learning machines. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed models.<<ETX>>",1993,5,40,3,False,Computer Science,2085100318,H. Ichiki,145719769.0,M. Hagiwara,1747731.0,M.

Behind this simple equation lies a revolution in the study of knowledge, which has left the halls of philosophy for the labs of science. This book offers a cogent account of what such a move does to our understanding of the nature of learning, rationality, and intelligence. Bringing together evolutionary biology, psychology, and philosophy, Henry Plotkin presents a new science of knowledge, one that traces an unbreakable link between instinct and our ability to know. Contrary to the modern liberal idea that knowledge is something derived from experience, this science shows us that what we know is what our nature allows us to know, what our instincts tell us we must know. Since our ability to know our world depends primarily on what we call intelligence, intelligence must be understood as an extension of instinct. Drawing on contemporary evolutionary theory, especially notions of hierarchical structure and universal Darwinism, Plotkin tells us that the capacity for knowledge, which is what makes us human, is deeply rooted in our biology and, in a special sense, is shared by all living things. This leads to a discussion of animal and human intelligence as well as an appraisal of what an instinct-based capacity for knowledge might mean to our understanding of language, reasoning, emotion, and culture. The result is nothing less than a three-dimensional theory of our nature, in which all knowledge is adaptation and all adaptation is a specific form of knowledge.",1994,0,252,18,False,Psychology,40429633,H.

Machine learning algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. They are particularly useful for (a) poorly understood problem domains where little knowledge exists for the humans to develop effective algorithms; (b) domains where there are large databases containing valuable implicit regularities to be discovered; or (c) domains where programs must adapt to changing conditions. Not surprisingly, the field of software engineering turns out to be a fertile ground where many software development tasks could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms. In this paper, we first take a look at the characteristics and applicability of some frequently utilized machine learning algorithms.

The algorithm can be implemented online (during experimental data collection), avoiding the need for storage and post-processing.

Under these conditions, the proposed construction preserves flexibility of training, systematically improvable accuracy, and a clear framework for validation of the underlying machine learning technique.

However, NMF has the drawback of being highly ill-posed, that is, there typically exist many different but equivalent factorizations. In this paper, we introduce a completely new way to obtaining more well-posed NMF problems whose solutions are sparser. Our technique is based on the preprocessing of the nonnegative input data matrix, and relies on the theory of M-matrices and the geometric interpretation of NMF. This approach provably leads to optimal and sparse solutions under the separability assumption of Donoho and Stodden (2003), and, for rank-three matrices, makes the number of exact factorizations finite.

We propose a semi-infinite quadratically constrained linear program formulation for the optimization, which can be solved iteratively to find a global optimum solution. We further propose to employ an additional pruning strategy, which significantly improves the efficiency of the algorithm, while retaining the convergence property of the algorithm.

Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time.

Possible solutions to the problems outlined by Gould are suggested via reviews of: (i) improved statistical methods, and (ii) recent inductive machine learning techniques. Following this, some newer problems with inference are described, emerging from the increased complexity of geographical datasets and from the analysis tasks to which we put them.

The scheme is based on resampling, with multiple models being generated based on subsampling of the same training data. The accuracy of the uncertainty prediction can be benchmarked by maximum likelihood estimation, which can also be used to correct for correlations between resampled models and to improve the performance of the uncertainty estimation by a cross-validation procedure. In the case of sparse Gaussian Process Regression models, this resampled estimator can be evaluated at negligible cost. We demonstrate the reliability of these estimates for the prediction of molecular and materials energetics and for the estimation of nuclear chemical shieldings in molecular crystals. Extension to estimate the uncertainty in energy differences, forces, or other correlated predictions is straightforward.

Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this problem. Methods and Results We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using a 13‐year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD‐free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC/AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5% 10‐year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8% of the 480 “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71. In contrast, ML Risk Calculator recommended only 11.4% to take statin, and only 14.4% of “Hard CVD” events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.95, and AUC 0.92. Similar results were found for prediction of “All CVD” events. Conclusions The ML Risk Calculator outperformed the ACC/AHA Risk Calculator by recommending less drug therapy, yet missing fewer events.

However, data in real world are often continuous in nature. Even for algorithms that can directly deal with continuous features, learning is often less efficient and effective. Hence discretization addresses this issue by finding the intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify. Discretization of continuous attributes is one of the important data preprocessing steps of knowledge extraction. An effective discretization method not only can reduce the demand of system memory and improve the efficiency of data mining and machine learning algorithm, but also make the knowledge extracted from the discretized dataset more compact, easy to be understand and used. In this paper, different types of traditional Supervised and Unsupervised discretization techniques along with examples, as well as their advantages and drawbacks have been discussed.",2011,10,95,2,False,Computer Science,35199040,Rajashree Dash,67334749.0,Rajib Lochan Paramguru,40567424.0,Rasmita Dash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They always change their behavior; so, we need to use an unsupervised learning. Fraudsters learn about new technology that allows them to execute frauds through online transactions. Fraudsters assume the regular behavior of consumers, and fraud patterns change fast. So, fraud detection systems need to detect online transactions by using unsupervised learning, because some fraudsters commit frauds once through online mediums and then switch to other techniques. This paper aims to 1) focus on fraud cases that cannot be detected based on previous history or supervised learning, 2) create a model of deep Auto-encoder and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that can reconstruct normal transactions to find anomalies from normal patterns. The proposed deep learning based on auto-encoder (AE) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that applies backpropagation by setting the inputs equal to the outputs. The RBM has two layers, the input layer (visible) and hidden layer. In this research, we use the Tensorflow library from Google to implement AE, RBM, and H2O by using deep learning.

However, as the standard approach is to train the network to minimize a prediction loss, the resultant model remains ignorant to its prediction confidence. Orthogonally to Bayesian neural nets that indirectly infer prediction uncertainty through weight uncertainties, we propose explicit modeling of the same using the theory of subjective logic. By placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural net as subjective opinions and learn the function that collects the evidence leading to these opinions by a deterministic neural net from data. The resultant predictor for a multi-class classification problem is another Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are set by the continuous output of a neural net.

The immense quantity of text documents available on the web can be properly filtered, organised and retrieved with the use of text genre classification, which may have potential use on several other tasks of natural language processing and information retrieval. Genre may refer to several aspects of text documents, such as function and purpose. The language function analysis (LFA) concentrates on single aspect of genres and it aims to classify text documents into three abstract classes, such as expressive, appellative and informative. Text genre classification is typically performed by supervised machine learning algorithms. The extraction of an efficient feature set to represent text documents is an essential task for building a robust classification scheme with high predictive performance. In addition, ensemble learning, which combines the outputs of individual classifiers to obtain a robust classification scheme, is a promising research field in machine learning research. In this regard, this article presents an extensive comparative analysis of different feature engineering schemes (such as features used in authorship attribution, linguistic features, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words) and five different base learners (Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour and Random Forest) in conjunction with ensemble learning methods (such as Boosting, Bagging and Random Subspace). Based on the empirical analysis, an ensemble classification scheme is presented, which integrates Random Subspace ensemble of Random Forest with four types of features (features used in authorship attribution, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words).

However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in- and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In essence, our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural networks for out-of-distribution.

Two well-known methods are boosting (see, e.g., Shapire et al., 1998) and bagging Breiman (1996) of classification trees. In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction. In bagging, successive trees do not depend on earlier trees — each is independently constructed using a bootstrap sample of the data set. In the end, a simple majority vote is taken for prediction. Breiman (2001) proposed random forests, which add an additional layer of randomness to bagging. In addition to constructing each tree using a different bootstrap sample of the data, random forests change how the classification or regression trees are constructed. In standard trees, each node is split using the best split among all variables. In a random forest, each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node. This somewhat counterintuitive strategy turns out to perform very well compared to many other classifiers, including discriminant analysis, support vector machines and neural networks, and is robust against overfitting (Breiman, 2001). In addition, it is very user-friendly in the sense that it has only two parameters (the number of variables in the random subset at each node and the number of trees in the forest), and is usually not very sensitive to their values. The randomForest package provides an R interface to the Fortran programs by Breiman and Cutler (available at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/ users/breiman/).

Although subjective visual interpretation remains the clinical mainstay, quantitative analysis facilitates objective, evidence-based management, and advances in clinical research. This has driven developments in computing and software tools aimed at achieving fully automated image processing and quantitative analysis. In parallel, machine learning techniques have been used to rapidly integrate large amounts of clinical and quantitative imaging data to provide highly personalized individual patient-based conclusions. Areas covered: This review summarizes recent advances in automated quantitative imaging in cardiology and describes the latest techniques which incorporate machine learning principles. The review focuses on the cardiac imaging techniques which are in wide clinical use. It also discusses key issues and obstacles for these tools to become utilized in mainstream clinical practice. Expert commentary: Fully-automated processing and high-level computer interpretation of cardiac imaging are becoming a reality. Application of machine learning to the vast amounts of quantitative data generated per scan and integration with clinical data also facilitates a move to more patient-specific interpretation. These developments are unlikely to replace interpreting physicians but will provide them with highly accurate tools to detect disease, risk-stratify, and optimize patient-specific treatment.

The DF was treated as the AD-related features, reduced by principal component analysis (PCA), and finally fed into three classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM (GEPSVM), and twin SVM (TSVM). The 10-fold cross validation repeated 50 times. Results. The results showed the “DF + PCA + TSVM” achieved the accuracy of 92.75 ± 1.77, sensitivity of 90.56 ± 1.15, specificity of 93.37 ± 2.05, and precision of 79.61 ± 2.21.

This paper presents a new method for generating ensembles that directly constructs diverse hypotheses using additional artificially-constructed training examples. The technique is a simple, general metalearner that can use any strong learner as a base classifier to build diverse committees. Experimental results using decision-tree induction as a base learner demonstrate that this approach consistently achieves higher predictive accuracy than both the base classifier and bagging (whereas boosting can occasionally decrease accuracy), and also obtains higher accuracy than boosting early in the learning curve when training data is limited.",2003,22,296,15,False,Computer Science,2780489,Prem Melville,1797655.0,R.

With these databases it is difficult to specify queries directly and explicitly. Relevance feedback interactively learns a user’s desired output or query concept by asking the user whether certain proposed images are relevant or not. For a learning algorithm to be effective, it must learn a user’s query concept accurately and quickly, while also asking the user to label only a small number of images. In addition, the concept-learning algorithm should consider the complexity a concept in determining its learning strategies. In this paper, we present the use of support vector machines active learning in a concept-dependent way (SVM Active) for conducting relevance feedback. We characterize a concept’s complexity using three measures: hit-rate, isolation and diversity. To reduce concept complexity so as to improve concept learnability, we propose a multimodal learning approach that uses images’ semantic labels to intelligently adjust the sampling strategy and the sampling pool of SVM Active . Our empirical study on several datasets shows that active learning outperforms traditional passive learning, and concept-dependent learning is superior to the traditional conceptindependent relevance-feedback schemes.",2005,70,62,2,False,Computer Science,33794424,E.

Although the precise motivations behind these schemes may differ, the common denominator lies in the fact that unsuspecting users visit their sites. These visits can be driven by email, web search results or links from other web pages. In all cases, however, the user is required to take some action, such as clicking on a desired Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In order to identify these malicious sites, the web security community has developed blacklisting services. These blacklists are in turn constructed by an array of techniques including manual reporting, honeypots, and web crawlers combined with site analysis heuristics. Inevitably, many malicious sites are not blacklisted either because they are too recent or were never or incorrectly evaluated. In this paper, we address the detection of malicious URLs as a binary classification problem and study the performance of several well-known classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Decision Trees, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors. Furthermore, we adopted a public dataset comprising 2.4 million URLs (instances) and 3.2 million features.

The proposed learning paradigm is centered around the concept of constraint, representing the interactions with the environment, and the parsimony principle. The classical regularization framework of kernel machines is naturally extended to the case in which the agents interact with a richer environment, where abstract granules of knowledge, compactly described by different linguistic formalisms, can be translated into the unified notion of constraint for defining the hypothesis set. Constrained variational calculus is exploited to derive general representation theorems that provide a description of the optimal body of the agent (i.e., the functional structure of the optimal solution to the learning problem), which is the basis for devising new learning algorithms. We show that regardless of the kind of constraints, the optimal body of the agent is a support constraint machine (SCM) based on representer theorems that extend classical results for kernel machines and provide new representations. In a sense, the expressiveness of constraints yields a semantic-based regularization theory, which strongly restricts the hypothesis set of classical regularization. Some guidelines to unify continuous and discrete computational mechanisms are given so as to accommodate in the same framework various kinds of stimuli, for example, supervised examples and logic predicates. The proposed view of learning from constraints incorporates classical learning from examples and extends naturally to the case in which the examples are subsets of the input space, which is related to learning propositional logic clauses.",2015,111,45,0,True,Medicine,2264182,G.

This was possible by combining the advantages of SVM - convexity and the availability of efficient optimizers, with 'hyperkernels' - linear combinations of kernels computed at multiple levels of image encoding. The use of hyperkernels faces the challenge of choosing the kernel weights, the use of possibly irrelevant, poorly performing kernels, and an increased number of parameters that can lead to overfitting. In this paper we advocate the transition from SVMs to Support Kernel Machines (SKM) - models that estimate both the parameters of a sparse linear combination of kernels, and the parameters of a discriminative classifier. We exploit recent kernel learning techniques, not previously used in computer vision, that show how learning SKMs can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently using Sequential Minimal Optimization. We study kernel learning for several multi-level image encodings for supervised object recognition and report competitive results on several datasets, including INRIA pedestrian, Caltech 101 and the newly created Caltech 256.",2007,19,83,10,False,Mathematics,2119321914,Ankita Kumar,1781120.0,C.

The recent great improvements on benchmark data sets, which are achieved by increasingly complex unsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters, usually require many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually, and training the deep models costs quite long time to fine-tune their weights. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine-Autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed as the learning unit to learn local receptive fields at each layer, and the lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation to retain more information. In addition, some beneficial methods in deep learning architectures such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine networks to further boost the performance. The obtained trans-layer representations are followed by block histograms with binary hashing to learn translation and rotation invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as recognition and detection. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, the proposed trans-layer representation method with ELM-AE based learning of local receptive filters has much faster learning speed and is validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST and MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101. State-of-the-art performances are achieved on both Caltech 101 15 samples per class task and 4 of 6 MNIST variations data sets, and highly impressive results are obtained on MNIST data set and other tasks.",2015,45,52,3,False,Computer Science,50017718,Wentao Zhu,145235303.0,Jun Miao,2343895.0,Laiyun Qing,145678691.0,G.

In this work, we have systematically analyzed the amino acid compositions of 3075 mesophilic and 1609 thermophilic proteins belonging to 9 and 15 families, respectively. We found that the charged residues Lys, Arg, and Glu as well as the hydrophobic residues, Val and Ile have higher occurrence in thermophiles than mesophiles. Further, we have analyzed the performance of different methods, based on Bayes rules, logistic functions, neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and so forth for discriminating mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. We found that most of the machine learning techniques discriminate these classes of proteins with similar accuracy. The neural network‐based method could discriminate the thermophiles from mesophiles at the five‐fold cross‐validation accuracy of 89% in a dataset of 4684 proteins. Moreover, this method is tested with 325 mesophiles in Xylella fastidosa and 382 thermophiles in Aquifex aeolicus and it could successfully discriminate them with the accuracy of 91%.

Recent systems exploit this property to achieve adaptability and efficiency in unreliable computing environments by relaxing the consistency of execution and allowing calculation errors to be self-corrected during training. However, the behavior of such systems are only well understood for specific types of calculation errors, such as those caused by staleness, reduced precision, or asynchronicity, and for specific types of training algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent. In this paper, we develop a general framework to quantify the effects of calculation errors on iterative-convergent algorithms and use this framework to design new strategies for checkpoint-based fault tolerance. Our framework yields a worst-case upper bound on the iteration cost of arbitrary perturbations to model parameters during training. Our system, SCAR, employs strategies which reduce the iteration cost upper bound due to perturbations incurred when recovering from checkpoints. We show that SCAR can reduce the iteration cost of partial failures by 78% - 95% when compared with traditional checkpoint-based fault tolerance across a variety of ML models and training algorithms.",2018,66,20,2,False,Computer Science,1762117,Aurick Qiao,2050920.0,Bryon Aragam,1745132.0,Bingjing Zhang,143977260.0,E.

A machine learning function provides reliable input information to a robust state estimation algorithm.

A cross-sectional database study. Objective. The aim of this study was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion. Summary of Background Data. Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery. Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class ≥3, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the accuracy of our machine learning models. Results. On the basis of AUC values, ANN and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound complications and mortality. Conclusion. Machine learning in the form of logistic regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine surgery.

The analogue machine has 18 input quantities from which it can compute in about 2 millisec 94 terms of a polynomial, each term containing products and powers of the input quantities, with adjustable coefficients, and can form their sum. The input quantities may be, for instance, 18 past samples of the values of a stochastic variable which is fed into the machine, and the result of the computation is an output function which contains 94 free variables. The training device optimizes the output by successive adjustment of the variable coefficients, until it has approached a target function as closely as can be achieved with a polynomial of 94 terms, by the criterion of the least mean-square error. This is done by repeatedly feeding into the machine a record of the stochastic process, long enough to be representative, and adjusting the variable coefficients, one at a time after each run, by a strategy which ensures that the error will monotonically decrease from run to run.In order to make the machine an optimum filter it is trained on a record of a noisy process, together with a target record which contains the signal only. It is taught as a predictor by taking as the target function a value of the stochastic process advanced by a certain time interval beyond the last value which goes into the input. It is trained as a simulator, for instance of an unknown mechanism, by feeding it with the input of the mechanism to be simulated at one end and presenting it at the other with its output as target function. The machine will then make itself into a model of the device to be simulated and the non-linear transfer function of the device can be read off from the final setting of the coefficients, as nearly as it can be represented by a 94-term polynomial. The machine is not confined to single-input systems.The machine incorporates 80 analogue multipliers of a novel ‘piezomagnetic’ type which, in its present form, can perform over 1000 multiplications per second with an error of 0.5% or less.A few examples of the first test applications of the machine are described.",1961,2,138,0,False,Computer Science,16298171,D.

However, traditional ANNs are mostly trained by gradient-based learning algorithms which usually suffer from excessive training and tuning burden as well as unsatisfactory generalization performance. Based on the ensemble learning strategy, this paper develops an ensemble model of a promising novel learning technology called extreme learning machine (ELM) for high-quality STLF of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The model consists of a series of single ELMs. During the training, the ensemble model generalizes the randomness of single ELMs by selecting not only random input parameters but also random hidden nodes within a pre-defined range. The forecast result is taken as the median value the single ELM outputs. Owing to the very fast training/tuning speed of ELM, the model can be efficiently updated to on-line track the variation trend of the electricity load and maintain the accuracy. The developed model is tested with the NEM historical load data and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art learning algorithms. The results show that the training efficiency and the forecasting accuracy of the developed model are superior over the competitive algorithms.",2013,23,156,15,False,Engineering,49775519,Rui Zhang,144402926.0,Z.

In this paper, we propose to study a new problem, i.e., building a learning system that learns cumulatively. As time goes by, the system sees and learns more and more classes of data and becomes more and more knowledgeable. We believe that this is similar to human learning. We humans learn continuously, retaining the learned knowledge, identifying and learning new things, and updating the existing knowledge with new experiences. Over time, we cumulate more and more knowledge. A learning system should be able to do the same. As algorithmic learning matures, it is time to tackle this cumulative machine learning (or simply cumulative learning) problem, which is a kind of lifelong machine learning problem. It presents two major challenges. First, the system must be able to detect data from unseen classes in the test set. Classic supervised learning, however, assumes all classes in testing are known or seen at the training time. Second, the system needs to be able to selectively update its models whenever a new class of data arrives without re-training the whole system using the entire past and present training data. This paper proposes a novel approach and system to tackle these challenges. Experimental results on two datasets with learning from 2 classes to up to 100 classes show that the proposed approach is highly promising in terms of both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.",2016,47,80,8,True,Computer Science,2193585,Geli Fei,1717480.0,Shuai Wang,145321667.0,B.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on “flattening the curve”. While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques.
