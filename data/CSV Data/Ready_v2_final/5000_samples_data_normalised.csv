In practice, we search for a function f with a finite representation f = Σi ci φi(·). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.",2007,38,88,8,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,11691394.0,R.

However, while there are clever tools developed to understand online customer’s behaviours in order to increase sales and profit, there is very little done to automatically discover access patterns to understand learners’ behaviour on webbased distance learning. Educators, using on-line learning environments and tools, have very little support to evaluate learners’ activities and discriminate between different learners’ on-line behaviours.

With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists' use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists' mental models of interpretability tools.

However, despite the prominent properties of SVMs, they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as for pattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVMs is highly dependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involve millions or billions of data records where even multiple scans of the entire data are too expensive to perform. This paper presents a new method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), which is specifically designed for handling very large data sets. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples that carry the statistical summaries of the data such that the summaries maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. CB-SVM tries to generate the best SVM boundary for very large data sets given limited amount of resources.

The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in ""log-space,"" to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.",2014,41,191,20,False,Mathematics,Computer Science,144108062.0,Jasper Snoek,1754860.0,Kevin Swersky,1804104.0,R.

However, the fact that soft attention mechanisms perform a pass over the entire input sequence when producing each element in the output sequence precludes their use in online settings and results in a quadratic time complexity. Based on the insight that the alignment between input and output sequence elements is monotonic in many problems of interest, we propose an end-to-end differentiable method for learning monotonic alignments which, at test time, enables computing attention online and in linear time.

Recently, a generalization of this model and an algorithm for this generalization were introduced, showing significant advantages over the conventional MIL model in certain application areas. Unfortunately, this algorithm is inherently inefficient, preventing scaling to high dimensions. We reformulate this algorithm using a kernel for a support vector machine, reducing its time complexity from exponential to polynomial. Computing the kernel is equivalent to counting the number of axis-parallel boxes in a discrete, bounded space that contain at least one point from each of two multisets P and Q.

Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making.

In an ideal setting, we want to encrypt sensitive data to store them on a commercial cloud and run certain analyses without ever decrypting the data to preserve privacy. Homomorphic encryption technique is a promising candidate for secure data outsourcing, but it is a very challenging task to support real-world machine learning tasks. Existing frameworks can only handle simplified cases with low-degree polynomials such as linear means classifier and linear discriminative analysis. Objective The goal of this study is to provide a practical support to the mainstream learning models (eg, logistic regression). Methods We adapted a novel homomorphic encryption scheme optimized for real numbers computation. We devised (1) the least squares approximation of the logistic function for accuracy and efficiency (ie, reduce computation cost) and (2) new packing and parallelization techniques. Results Using real-world datasets, we evaluated the performance of our model and demonstrated its feasibility in speed and memory consumption. For example, it took approximately 116 minutes to obtain the training model from the homomorphically encrypted Edinburgh dataset. In addition, it gives fairly accurate predictions on the testing dataset. Conclusions We present the first homomorphically encrypted logistic regression outsourcing model based on the critical observation that the precision loss of classification models is sufficiently small so that the decision plan stays still.",2018,45,164,11,True,Medicine,Computer Science,50619349.0,Miran Kim,11977411.0,Yongsoo Song,49184748.0,Shuang Wang,9689501.0,Yuhou Xia,1935336.0,Xiaoqian Jiang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our first contribution is a heterogeneity-aware algorithm that uses a constant learning rate schedule for updates before adding them to the global parameter. This allows us to suppress stragglers' harm on robust convergence. As a further improvement, our second contribution is a more sophisticated learning rate schedule that takes into consideration the delayed information of each update.

Thus, the probable risk factors and association between these factors and motorcycle crash severity outcomes is not known. Traditional statistical models have intrinsic assumptions and pre-defined correlations that, if flouted, can generate inaccurate results. In this study, machine learning based algorithms were employed to predict and classify motorcycle crash severity. Machine learning based techniques are non-parametric models without the presumption of relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. The main aim of this research is to evaluate and compare different approaches to modeling motorcycle crash severity as well as investigating the effect of risk factors on the injury outcomes of motorcycle crashes. Motorcycle crash dataset between 2011 and 2015 was extracted from the National Road Traffic Crash Database at the Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) in Ghana. The dataset was classified into four injury severity categories: fatal, hospitalized, injured, and damage-only. Three machine learning based models were developed: J48 Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest (RF) and Instance-Based learning with parameter k (IBk) were employed to model the severity of injury in a motorcycle crash. These machine learning algorithms were validated using 10-fold cross-validation technique. The three machine learning based algorithms were compared with one another and the statistical model: multinomial logit model (MNLM). Also, the relative importance analysis of the attribute was conducted to determine the impact of these attributes on injury severity outcomes.

Toward this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The FL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from a server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server, while asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve the model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private data, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are with limited computational resources (i.e., requiring longer update time) or under poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL protocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL efficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions. Specifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource constraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models. We conducted an experimental evaluation using publicly-available large-scale image datasets to train deep neural networks on MEC environment simulations. The experimental results show that FedCS is able to complete its training process in a significantly shorter time compared to the original FL protocol.",2018,20,597,56,True,Computer Science,,3037568.0,T.

Due to decoupled control and data plane, Software Defined Networks (SDN) can handle these increasing number of attacks by blocking those network connections at the switch level. However, the challenge lies in defining the set of rules on the SDN controller to block malicious network connections. Historical network attack data can be used to automatically identify and block the malicious connections. There are a few existing open-source software tools to monitor and limit the number of login attempts per source IP address one-by-one.

However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease.

Its accurate evaluation from first principles requires quantum chemistry methods that are often too demanding for routine use. The highly accurate calculations reported herein provide a much-needed benchmark of the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as well as training data for a machine-learning model that can predict the polarizability tensor with an error that is about 50% smaller than DFT. This framework provides an accurate, inexpensive, and transferable strategy for estimating the polarizabilities of molecules containing dozens of atoms, and therefore removes a considerable obstacle to accurate and reliable atomistic-based modeling of matter. The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.",2018,65,95,0,True,Medicine,Physics,6287077.0,D.

However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximised over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximising an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the non-linear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain or partially missing inputs.

How can we get a machine to learn language? It first presents an explicit computational model of language acquisition which can actually learn rules of English syntax given a sequence of grammatical, but otherwise unprepared, sentences.It shows that natural languages are designed to be easily learned and easily processed-an exciting breakthrough from the point of view of artificial intelligence and the design of expert systems because it shows how extensive knowledge might be acquired automatically, without outside intervention. Computationally, the book demonstrates how constraints that may be reasonably assumed to aid sentence processing also aid language acquisition.Chapters in the book's second part apply computational methods to the general problem of developmental growth, particularly the thorny problem of the interaction between innate genetic endowment and environmental input, with the intent of uncovering the constraints on the acquisition of syntactic knowledge. A number of ""mini-theories"" of learning are incorporated in this study of syntax with results that should appeal to a wide range of scholarly interests. These include how lexical categories, phonological rule systems, and phrase structure rules are learned; the role of semantic-syntactic interaction in language acquisition; how a ""parameter setting"" model may be formalized as a learning procedure; how multiple constraints (from syntax, thematic knowledge, or phrase structure) interact to aid acquisition; how transformational-type rules may be learned; and, the role of lexical ambiguity in language acquisition.Robert Berwick is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.

In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of “free” self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our framework over all the compared competing methods.",2019,62,50,0,True,Medicine,Computer Science,3170394.0,Keze Wang,1737218.0,Liang Lin,19217972.0,Chenhan Jiang,2005026919.0,C.

We introduce two structured labeling solutions, a novel technique we propose for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label.

Given an error probability e, together with a method that makes a prediction ŷ of a label y, it produces a set of labels, typically containing ŷ, that also contains y with probability 1  e. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing ŷ: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right 1  e of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating data set rather than on independent data sets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples.

Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only. Results Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78% for 10 categories; 92% for membrane‐bound or soluble), outperforming current state‐of‐the‐art algorithms, including those relying on homology information.

The classification scheme is based on Simpson's fuzzy min-max method (1992, 1993) and relaxes some assumptions he makes. This enables our scheme to handle mutually nonexclusive classes. The neuro-fuzzy clustering scheme is a multiresolution algorithm that is modeled after the mechanics of human pattern recognition. We also present data from an exhaustive comparison of these techniques with neural, statistical, machine learning, and other traditional approaches to pattern recognition applications. The data sets used for comparisons include those from the machine learning repository at the University of California, Irvine. We find that our proposed schemes compare quite well with the existing techniques, and in addition offer the advantages of one-pass learning and online adaptation.",1997,80,86,4,False,Computer Science,Medicine,145029954.0,A.

A crucial requirement for building sustainable learning models, though, is to train on a wide variety of malware samples. Unfortunately, malware evolves rapidly and it thus becomes hard—if not impossible—to generalize learning models to reflect future, previously-unseen behaviors. Consequently, most malware classifiers become unsustainable in the long run, becoming rapidly antiquated as malware continues to evolve. In this work, we propose Transcend, a framework to identify aging classification models in vivo during deployment, much before the machine learning model’s performance starts to degrade. This is a significant departure from conventional approaches that retrain aging models retrospectively when poor performance is observed. Our approach uses a statistical comparison of samples seen during deployment with those used to train the model, thereby building metrics for prediction quality. We show how Transcend can be used to identify concept drift based on two separate case studies on Android andWindows malware, raising a red flag before the model starts making consistently poor decisions due to out-of-date training.",2017,24,168,12,False,Computer Science,,2329376.0,Roberto Jordaney,145619083.0,K.

Such name ambiguity affects the performance of document retrieval, Web search, database integration, and may cause improper attribution to authors. We investigate two supervised learning approaches to disambiguate authors in the citations. One approach uses the naive Bayes probability model, a generative model; the other uses support vector machines (SVMs) [V. Vapnik (1995)] and the vector space representation of citations, a discriminative model. Both approaches utilize three types of citation attributes: coauthor names, the title of the paper, and the title of the journal or proceeding.

In this paper, we show that prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers to perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data samples, such as the attack accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we first propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack method based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose benchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with knowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model accuracy and privacy risks. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that existing defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported. Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate that the distribution of the privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous. Finally, we perform an in-depth investigation for understanding why certain samples have high privacy risk scores, including correlations with model sensitivity, generalization error, and feature embeddings. Our work emphasizes the importance of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of privacy risks of machine learning models.",2020,61,99,26,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,144173853.0,Liwei Song,143615345.0,Prateek Mittal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine‐learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5 years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine‐learning techniques, and review recent machine‐learning applications in otolaryngology–head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine‐learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care. Spreading awareness and confidence in machine learning will follow with further validation and proof‐of‐value analyses that demonstrate model performance superiority over established methods. We are poised to see a greater influx of machine‐learning applications to clinical problems in otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, and it is prudent for providers to understand the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies.

We use noisy, differentially-private gradients to minimize the fitness cost of the machine learning model using stochastic gradient descent. We quantify the quality of the trained model, using the fitness cost, as a function of privacy budget and size of the distributed datasets to capture the trade-off between privacy and utility in machine learning. This way, we can predict the outcome of collaboration among privacy-aware data owners prior to executing potentially computationally-expensive machine learning algorithms. Particularly, we show that the difference between the fitness of the trained machine learning model using differentially-private gradient queries and the fitness of the trained machine model in the absence of any privacy concerns is inversely proportional to the size of the training datasets squared and the privacy budget squared. We successfully validate the performance prediction with the actual performance of the proposed privacy-aware learning algorithms, applied to: financial datasets for determining interest rates of loans using regression; and detecting credit card frauds using support vector machines.",2019,35,44,4,True,Computer Science,Mathematics,2068343830.0,Nan Wu,145788331.0,Farhad Farokhi,2153149908.0,David B.

The advantages of attribute-based learning are: relative simplicity, efficiency, and existence of effective techniques for handling noisy data. However, attribute-based learning is limited to non-relational descriptions of objects in the sense that the learned descriptions do not specify relations among the objects' parts.

We hypothesize that the functional health of individuals, or ability of individuals to perform activities independently without assistance, can be estimated by tracking their activities using smart home technologies. In this paper, we introduce a machine-learning-based method to assess activity quality in smart homes. To validate our approach, we quantify activity quality for 179 volunteer participants who performed a complex, interweaved set of activities in our smart home apartment. We compare our automated assessment of task quality with direct observation scores. We also assess the ability of machine-learning techniques to predict the cognitive health of the participants based on these automated scores. We believe that this capability is an important step in understanding everyday functional health of individuals in their home environments.",2013,50,151,8,True,Computer Science,Medicine,3410479.0,Prafulla N.

Computer vision, speech recognition and language translation have all seen a near human level performance. We expect, in the near future, most business applications will have some form of ML. However, testing such applications is extremely challenging and would be very expensive if we follow today's methodologies. In this work, we present an articulation of the challenges in testing ML based applications. We then present our solution approach, based on the concept of Metamorphic Testing, which aims to identify implementation bugs in ML based image classifiers.

This training typically involves many iterations that continually improve the quality of the model. Yet in exploratory settings, better models can be obtained faster by directing resources to jobs with the most potential for improvement. We describe SLAQ, a cluster scheduling system for approximate ML training jobs that aims to maximize the overall job quality. When allocating cluster resources, SLAQ explores the quality-runtime trade-offs across multiple jobs to maximize system-wide quality improvement. To do so, SLAQ leverages the iterative nature of ML training algorithms, by collecting quality and resource usage information from concurrent jobs, and then generating highly-tailored quality-improvement predictions for future iterations. Experiments show that SLAQ achieves an average quality improvement of up to 73% and an average delay reduction of up to 44% on a large set of ML training jobs, compared to resource fairness schedulers.",2017,59,99,14,True,Computer Science,,2051632731.0,Haoyu Zhang,26315993.0,Logan Stafman,46782066.0,Andrew Or,3122063.0,M.

Their negative impact on source code maintainability and comprehensibility has been widely shown in the past and several techniques to automatically detect them have been devised. Most of these techniques are based on heuristics, namely they compute a set of code metrics and combine them by creating detection rules; while they have a reasonable accuracy, a recent trend is represented by the use of machine learning where code metrics are used as predictors of the smelliness of code artefacts. Despite the recent advances in the field, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge of whether machine learning can actually be more accurate than traditional heuristic-based approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a large-scale study to empirically compare the performance of heuristic-based and machine-learning-based techniques for metric-based code smell detection. We consider five code smell types and compare machine learning models with DECOR, a state-of-the-art heuristic-based approach. Key findings emphasize the need of further research aimed at improving the effectiveness of both machine learning and heuristic approaches for code smell detection: while DECOR generally achieves better performance than a machine learning baseline, its precision is still too low to make it usable in practice.",2019,98,47,1,False,Computer Science,,133972345.0,Fabiano Pecorelli,34946033.0,Fabio Palomba,50515157.0,Dario Di Nucci,145818752.0,A.

Given that the true class should be included in predictions and the number of classes predicted should be as small as possible, these kind of classifiers can be considered as Information Retrieval (IR) procedures. In this paper, we propose a family of IR loss functions to measure the performance of nondeterministic learners. After discussing such measures, we derive an algorithm for learning optimal nondeterministic hypotheses. Given an entry from the input space, the algorithm requires the posterior probabilities to compute the subset of classes with the lowest expected loss. From a general point of view, nondeterministic classifiers provide an improvement in the proportion of predictions that include the true class compared to their deterministic counterparts; the price to be paid for this increase is usually a tiny proportion of predictions with more than one class. The paper includes an extensive experimental study using three deterministic learners to estimate posterior probabilities: a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Logistic Regression, and a Naive Bayes. The data sets considered comprise both UCI multi-class learning tasks and microarray expressions of different kinds of cancer. We successfully compare nondeterministic classifiers with other alternative approaches. Additionally, we shall see how the quality of posterior probabilities (measured by the Brier score) determines the goodness of nondeterministic predictions.",2009,28,71,9,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,2258395.0,J.

Similarly, most learning techniques used in practice are brittle to the presence of large amounts of biased or malicious data. Motivated by this, we consider two frameworks for studying estimation, learning, and optimization in the presence of significant fractions of arbitrary data. The first framework, list-decodable learning, asks whether it is possible to return a list of answers such that at least one is accurate. For example, given a dataset of n points for which an unknown subset of αn points are drawn from a distribution of interest, and no assumptions are made about the remaining (1 - α)n points, is it possible to return a list of poly(1/α) answers? The second framework, which we term the semi-verified model, asks whether a small dataset of trusted data (drawn from the distribution in question) can be used to extract accurate information from a much larger but untrusted dataset (of which only an α-fraction is drawn from the distribution). We show strong positive results in both settings, and provide an algorithm for robust learning in a very general stochastic optimization setting. This result has immediate implications for robustly estimating the mean of distributions with bounded second moments, robustly learning mixtures of such distributions, and robustly finding planted partitions in random graphs in which significant portions of the graph have been perturbed by an adversary.",2016,49,237,19,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,1745732.0,M.

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error.

However, standard machine learning algorithmstypically scale exponentially with data volume and complexityof cross-modal couplings - the so called curse of dimensionality -which is prohibitive to the analysis of large-scale, multi-modal andmulti-relational datasets. Given that such data are often efficientlyrepresented as multiway arrays or tensors, it is therefore timely andvaluable for the multidisciplinary machine learning and data analyticcommunities to review low-rank tensor decompositions and tensor networksas emerging tools for dimensionality reduction and large scaleoptimization problems. Our particular emphasis is on elucidating that,by virtue of the underlying low-rank approximations, tensor networkshave the ability to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in a numberof applied areas. In Part 1 of this monograph we provide innovativesolutions to low-rank tensor network decompositions and easy to interpretgraphical representations of the mathematical operations ontensor networks. Such a conceptual insight allows for seamless migrationof ideas from the flat-view matrices to tensor network operationsand vice versa, and provides a platform for further developments, practicalapplications, and non-Euclidean extensions. It also permits theintroduction of various tensor network operations without an explicitnotion of mathematical expressions, which may be beneficial for manyresearch communities that do not directly rely on multilinear algebra.Our focus is on the Tucker and tensor train TT decompositions andtheir extensions, and on demonstrating the ability of tensor networksto provide linearly or even super-linearly e.g., logarithmically scalablesolutions, as illustrated in detail in Part 2 of this monograph.",2016,279,324,21,True,Computer Science,,145683892.0,A.

We study this approach with new multi-class classification methods and examined many issues important for a practical recognition system.RESULTS Most current discriminative methods for protein fold prediction use the one-against-others method, which has the well-known 'False Positives' problem. We investigated two new methods: the unique one-against-others and the all-against-all methods. Both improve prediction accuracy by 14-110% on a dataset containing 27 SCOP folds. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Neural Network (NN) learning methods as base classifiers. SVMs converges fast and leads to high accuracy. When scores of multiple parameter datasets are combined, majority voting reduces noise and increases recognition accuracy. We examined many issues involved with large number of classes, including dependencies of prediction accuracy on the number of folds and on the number of representatives in a fold. Overall, recognition systems achieve 56% fold prediction accuracy on a protein test dataset, where most of the proteins have below 25% sequence identity with the proteins used in training.",2001,31,890,136,True,Computer Science,Medicine,1737469.0,C.

Yet what makes a system “intelligible” is difficult to pin down. Intelligibility is a fundamentally human-centered concept that lacks a one-size-fits-all solution. Although many intelligibility techniques have been proposed in the machine learning literature, there are many more open questions about how best to provide stakeholders with the information they need to achieve their desired goals. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the intelligible machine learning landscape and give several examples of the diverse ways in which needs for intelligibility can arise. We provide an overview of the techniques for achieving intelligibility that have been proposed in the machine learning literature. We discuss the importance of taking a human-centered strategy when designing intelligibility techniques or when verifying that these techniques achieve their intended goals.
