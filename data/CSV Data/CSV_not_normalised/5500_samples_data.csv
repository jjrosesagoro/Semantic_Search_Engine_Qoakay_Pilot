Automated track inspection using computer vision and pattern recognition methods has recently shown the potential to improve safety by allowing for more frequent inspections while reducing human errors. Achieving full automation is still very challenging due to the number of different possible failure modes, as well as the broad range of image variations that can potentially trigger false alarms. In addition, the number of defective components is very small, so not many training examples are available for the machine to learn a robust anomaly detector. In this paper, we show that detection performance can be improved by combining multiple detectors within a multitask learning framework. We show that this approach results in improved accuracy for detecting defects on railway ties and fasteners.",2015,54,246,5,true,Engineering,2067146341,Xavier Gibert,1741177,Vishal M.

Over two hundred studies of fault prediction have been published in the last 10 years. There is evidence to suggest that the quality of methodology used in some of these studies does not allow us to have confidence in the predictions reported by them. We evaluate the machine learning methodology used in 21 fault prediction studies. All of these studies use NASA data sets. We score each study from 1 to 10 in terms of the quality of their machine learning methodology (e.g. whether or not studies report randomising their cross validation folds). Only 10 out of the 21 studies scored 5 or more out of 10. Furthermore 1 study scored only 1 out of 10. When we plot these scores over time there is no evidence that the quality of machine learning methodology is better in recent studies. Our results suggest that there remains much to be done by both researchers and reviewers to improve the quality of machine learning methodology used in software fault prediction. We conclude that the results reported in some studies need to be treated with caution.,2012,47,22,0,false,Computer Science,143936625,T. Hall,143969104,David Bowes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How do they do this? More specifically, how do children map from complex, physical signals to grammars that enable them to generate and interpret new utterances from their language? 
This thesis presents a computational theory of unsupervised language acquisition. By computational we mean that the theory precisely defines procedures for learning language, procedures that have been implemented and tested in the form of computer programs. By unsupervised we mean that the theory explains how language learning can take place with no explicit help from a teacher, but only exposure to ordinary spoken or written utterances. The theory requires very little of the learning environment. For example, it predicts that much knowledge of language can be acquired even in situations where the learner has no access to the meaning of utterances. In this way the theory is extremely conservative, making few or no assumptions that are not obviously true of the situation children learn in. 
The theory is based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical estimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic, generative model of language to the evidence. Thus, the goal of the learner is to acquire a grammar under which the evidence is ""typical"", in a statistical sense. Much of the thesis is devoted to explaining conditions that must hold for this learning strategy to arrive at the desired form of grammar. The thesis introduces a variety of technical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and grammars that has many linguistically and statistically desirable properties. In this representation, both utterances and parameters in the grammar are represented by composing parameters. A second contribution is a learning strategy that separates the ""content"" of linguistic parameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of the search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to language acquisition. 
The theory has been tested on problems of learning lexicons (vocabularies) from text and speech signals. It performs extremely well on various objective criteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same linguistic structure to utterances as humans do. The theory has application to data compression, speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval, and other tasks that rely on either structural or stochastic descriptions of language.

The first case occurs when obtaining examples of a second class is difficult, e.g., classifying sites of ""interest"" based on web accesses. The second situation is exemplified by the gene knock-out experiments for understanding Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor signalling pathway that provided the data for the second task of the KDD 2002 Cup, where minority one-class SVMs significantly outperform models learnt using examples from both classes.This paper explores the limits of supervised learning of a two class discrimination from data with heavily unbalanced class proportions. We focus on the case of supervised learning with support vector machines. We consider the impact of both sampling and weighting imbalance compensation techniques and then extend the balancing to extreme situations when one of the classes is ignored completely and the learning is accomplished using examples from a single class.Our investigation with the data for KDD 2002 Cup as well as text benchmarks such as Reuters Newswire shows that there is a consistent pattern of performance differences between one and two-class learning for all SVMs investigated, and these patterns persist even with aggressive dimensionality reduction through automated feature selection.

Such questions have a rich history spanning statistics, machine learning and theoretical computer science. Even in the most basic settings, the only known approaches are either computationally inefficient or lose dimension dependent factors in their error guarantees. This raises the following question: Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even possible, algorithmically? In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms for agnostically learning several fundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian, (2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product distributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of k Gaussians with identical spherical covariances. All our algorithms achieve error that is independent of the dimension, and in many cases depends nearly-linearly on the fraction of adversarially corrupted samples. Moreover, we develop a general recipe for detecting and correcting corruptions in high-dimensions, that may be applicable to many other problems.",2016,97,383,46,true,Computer Science,1808354,Ilias Diakonikolas,143835728,Gautam Kamath,Mathematics,2452522,D.

Using these effectors, the bacteria subvert host cell processes during infection. Legionella pneumophila translocates effectors via the Icm/Dot type-IV secretion system and to date, approximately 100 effectors have been identified by various experimental and computational techniques. Effector identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the pathogenesis system in L. pneumophila as well as in other bacterial pathogens. Here, we formulate the task of effector identification as a classification problem: each L. pneumophila open reading frame (ORF) was classified as either effector or not. We computationally defined a set of features that best distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features cover a wide range of characteristics including taxonomical dispersion, regulatory data, genomic organization, similarity to eukaryotic proteomes and more. Machine learning algorithms utilizing these features were then applied to classify all the ORFs within the L. pneumophila genome. Using this approach we were able to predict and experimentally validate 40 new effectors, reaching a success rate of above 90%. Increasing the number of validated effectors to around 140, we were able to gain novel insights into their characteristics. Effectors were found to have low G+C content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of effectors originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their protozoan host. In addition, effectors were found to cluster in specific genomic regions. Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the C-terminal translocation signal required for effector translocation by the Icm/Dot secretion system. To conclude, we have discovered 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors, predicted over a hundred additional highly probable effectors, and shown the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the identification and characterization of bacterial pathogenesis determinants.",2009,52,224,15,true,Biology,48688893,D.

The “alleged” inferior performance of TSVM is mainly because it was not tuned in the process, in addition to the involved minimization routines.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.",2018,31,191,3,true,Medicine,145959882,G.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.",2020,18,236,27,false,Computer Science,39483391,Hao Wang,2005216177,Zakhary Kaplan,,1714907,Di Niu,,91269142,Baochun Li,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These methods define a cooperative game between the features of a model and distribute influence among these input elements using some form of the game's unique Shapley values. Justification for these methods rests on two pillars: their desirable mathematical properties, and their applicability to specific motivations for explanations. We show that mathematical problems arise when Shapley values are used for feature importance and that the solutions to mitigate these necessarily induce further complexity, such as the need for causal reasoning. We also draw on additional literature to argue that Shapley values do not provide explanations which suit human-centric goals of explainability.",2020,32,156,9,false,Computer Science,102411992,Indra Elizabeth Kumar,72563021,S.

A sibling problem that has received relatively less attention is how to ensure efficient and correct model parallel execution of ML algorithms, where parameters of an ML program are partitioned to different workers and undergone concurrent iterative updates. We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design, algorithmic adjustment, and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we develop a system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs. STRADS enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models, and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML. We demonstrate the efficacy of model-parallel algorithms implemented on STRADS versus popular implementations for topic modeling, matrix factorization, and Lasso.",2014,31,99,7,false,Computer Science,1739906504,Seunghak Lee,2152674455,Jin Kyu Kim,,2496226,Xun Zheng,,1707357,Qirong Ho,30367882,Garth A.

However, data privacy severely restricts the applicability of such services, unless measures to keep client data private (even from the service provider) are designed. Equally important is to minimize the amount of computation and communication required between client and server. Fully homomorphic encryption offers a possible way out, whereby clients may encrypt their data, and on which the server may perform arithmetic computations. The main drawback of using fully homomorphic encryption is the amount of time required to evaluate large machine learning models on encrypted data.

Further, we test various ensemble approaches to aggregating the information products of the built models, providing more robust basis for measuring country-level vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide approaches to estimating model uncertainty in early-warning exercises, particularly model performance uncertainty and model output uncertainty.

Faces contain information that can be used to interpret levels of drowsiness. There are many facial features that can be extracted from the face to infer the level of drowsiness. These include eye blinks, head movements and yawning. However, the development of a drowsiness detection system that yields reliable and accurate results is a challenging task as it requires accurate and robust algorithms. A wide range of techniques has been examined to detect driver drowsiness in the past. The recent rise of deep learning requires that these algorithms be revisited to evaluate their accuracy in detection of drowsiness. As a result, this paper reviews machine learning techniques which include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models in the context of drowsiness detection. Furthermore, a meta-analysis is conducted on 25 papers that use machine learning techniques for drowsiness detection. The analysis reveals that support vector machine technique is the most commonly used technique to detect drowsiness, but convolutional neural networks performed better than the other two techniques. Finally, this paper lists publicly available datasets that can be used as benchmarks for drowsiness detection.",2017,54,59,2,false,Computer Science,32559888,Mkhuseli Ngxande,3165624,J.

GRADE uses historical admissions data to predict how likely the committee is to admit each new applicant. It reports each prediction as a score similar to those used by human reviewers, and accompanies each by an explanation of what applicant features most influenced its prediction. GRADE makes the review process more efficient by enabling reviewers to spend most of their time on applicants near the decision boundary and by focusing their attention on parts of each applicant’s file that matter the most.

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. Results: Age, platelet count, AST, and albumin were found to be statistically significant to advanced fibrosis.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have the ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections. However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful modification to the simple RNN (SRN) architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex, CW-RNN reduces the number of SRN parameters, improves the performance significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving three tasks: audio signal generation, TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms both SRN and LSTM networks, and online handwriting recognition, where it outperforms SRNs.",2014,41,419,66,false,Computer Science,2865775,J.

This weight vector is usually obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Based on this fact we present a direct method to build sparse kernel learning algorithms by adding one more constraint to the original convex optimization problem, such that the sparseness of the resulting kernel machine is explicitly controlled while at the same time performance is kept as high as possible. A gradient based approach is provided to solve this modified optimization problem. Applying this method to the support vectom machine results in a concrete algorithm for building sparse large margin classifiers.

For example, an image can be represented as a bag of segments and associated with a list of objects it contains. Prior work on MIML has focused on predicting label sets for previously unseen bags. We instead consider the problem of predicting instance labels while learning from data labeled only at the bag level. We propose Rank-Loss Support Instance Machines, which optimize a regularized rank-loss objective and can be instantiated with different aggregation models connecting instance-level predictions with bag-level predictions. The aggregation models that we consider are equivalent to defining a ""support instance"" for each bag, which allows efficient optimization of the rank-loss objective using primal sub-gradient descent. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than other loss functions used in prior work, e.g., Hamming loss, and recent work in ambiguous label classification.",2012,30,167,27,true,Computer Science,40022482,Forrest Briggs,1694273,Xiaoli Z.

Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms could benefit from good feature representation, explaining why deep learning has achieved breakthrough performance in many tasks. In deep learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most well-known approaches, since it incorporates feature learning and classification task in a unified network architecture. Although CNN has been successfully applied to image and text domains, it is still a challenge to apply CNN to time series data. This paper proposes a tensor scheme along with a novel deep learning architecture called multivariate convolutional neural network (MVCNN) for multivariate time series classification, in which the proposed architecture considers multivariate and lag-feature characteristics. We evaluate our proposed method with the prognostics and health management (PHM) 2015 challenge data, and compare with several algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other alternatives using the prediction score, which is the evaluation metric used by the PHM Society 2015 data challenge.

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.",2009,64,1071,37,false,Computer Science,1777528,H.

However, the performances of existing machine learning–based damage identification methods are heavily dependent on the selected signatures from raw signals. This will cause the fact that the damage identification method, which is the optimal solution for a specific application, may fail to provide the similar performance on other cases. Besides, the feature extraction is a time-consuming task, which may affect the real-time performance in practical applications. To address these problems, this article proposes a novel method based on deep convolutional neural networks to identify and localise damages of building structures equipped with smart control devices. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is capable of automatically extracting high-level features from raw signals or low-level features and optimally selecting the combination of extracted features via a multi-layer fusion to satisfy any damage identification objective. To evaluate the performance of the proposed deep convolutional neural network method, a five-level benchmark building equipped with adaptive smart isolators subjected to the seismic loading is investigated. The result shows that the proposed method has outstanding generalisation capacity and higher identification accuracy than other commonly used machine learning methods. Accordingly, it is deemed as an ideal and effective method for damage identification of smart structures.",2018,54,125,1,true,Computer Science,2152845752,Yang Yu,2518211,Chaoyue Wang,,51099962,X.

In order to overcome the low amount of labeled examples available in this setting, we introduce a new feature learning and extraction procedure based on a factor model we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C). Prior work on S3C has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale S3C to the enormous problem sizes needed for object recognition. We present a novel inference procedure for appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors that S3C may be trained with. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. 
The use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. 
Standard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. 
As a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. 
Text categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods.",1991,0,460,47,false,Computer Science,35153517,D.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done in quantum machine learning (QML) in federation setting yet. In this work, we present the federated training on hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models although our framework could be generalized to pure quantum machine learning model. Specifically, we consider the quantum neural network (QNN) coupled with classical pre-trained convolutional model.

We propose a novel multicategory generalization of ψ-learning that treats all classes simultaneously. The new generalization eliminates this potential problem while at the same time retaining the desirable properties of its binary counterpart. We develop a statistical learning theory for the proposed methodology and obtain fast convergence rates for both linear and nonlinear learning examples. We demonstrate the operational characteristics of this method through a simulation.

SCARE relies on a robust mechanism for horizontal data partitioning and a combination of machine learning techniques to predict the set of possible updates. Due to data partitioning, several updates can be predicted for a single record based on local views on each data partition.

Clinical methods, for instance, angiography is the best and most effective way of diagnosing HF, however, studies show that it is not only costly but has side effects as well. Lately, machine learning techniques have been used for the stated purpose. This survey paper aims to present a systematic literature review based on 35 journal articles published since 2012, where state of the art machine learning classification techniques have been implemented on heart disease datasets. This study critically analyzes the selected papers and finds gaps in the existing literature and is assistive for researchers who intend to apply machine learning in medical domains, particularly on heart disease datasets.

Pair-wise residue-residue contacts in proteins can be predicted from both threading templates and sequence-based machine learning. However, most structure modeling approaches only use the template-based contact predictions in guiding the simulations; this is partly because the sequence-based contact predictions are usually considered to be less accurate than that by threading. With the rapid progress in sequence databases and machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to have a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the contact-prediction methods in different template conditions.


RESULTS
We develop two methods for protein-contact predictions: SVM-SEQ is a sequence-based machine learning approach which trains a variety of sequence-derived features on contact maps; SVM-LOMETS collects consensus contact predictions from multiple threading templates. We test both methods on the same set of 554 proteins which are categorized into 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard' and 'Very Hard' targets based on the evolutionary and structural distance between templates and targets. For the Easy and Medium targets, SVM-LOMETS obviously outperforms SVM-SEQ; but for the Hard and Very Hard targets, the accuracy of the SVM-SEQ predictions is higher than that of SVM-LOMETS by 12-25%. If we combine the SVM-SEQ and SVM-LOMETS predictions together, the total number of correctly predicted contacts in the Hard proteins will increase by more than 60% (or 70% for the long-range contact with a sequence separation > or =24), compared with SVM-LOMETS alone. The advantage of SVM-SEQ is also shown in the CASP7 free modeling targets where the SVM-SEQ is around four times more accurate than SVM-LOMETS in the long-range contact prediction. These data demonstrate that the state-of-the-art sequence-based contact prediction has reached a level which may be helpful in assisting tertiary structure modeling for the targets which do not have close structure templates. The maximum yield should be obtained by the combination of both sequence- and template-based predictions.",2008,51,190,19,true,Computer Science,47403471,Sitao Wu,41071620,Yang Zhang,Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed neural network is guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution of support vector classification and regression. Compared with the existing two-layer neural network for the SVM classification, the proposed neural network has a low complexity for implementation. Moreover, the proposed neural network can converge exponentially to the optimal solution of SVM learning. The rate of the exponential convergence can be made arbitrarily high by simply turning up a scaling parameter.

However, parallelizing DNN training across computers has been difficult. We present the Deep Stacking Network (DSN), which overcomes the problem of parallelizing learning algorithms for deep architectures. The DSN provides a method of stacking simple processing modules in buiding deep architectures, with a convex learning problem in each module. Additional fine tuning further improves the DSN, while introducing minor non-convexity. Full learning in the DSN is batch-mode, making it amenable to parallel training over many machines and thus be scalable over the potentially huge size of the training data. Experimental results on both the MNIST (image) and TIMIT (speech) classification tasks demonstrate that the DSN learning algorithm developed in this work is not only parallelizable in implementation but it also attains higher classification accuracy than the DNN.",2012,16,199,15,false,Computer Science,144718788,L.

According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 246 million diabetic people worldwide, and this number is expected to rise to 380 million by 2025. Furthermore, 3.8 million deaths are attributable to diabetes complications each year. It has been shown that 80% of type 2 diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed by early identification of people at risk. In this context, several data mining and machine learning methods have been used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. In this paper, we propose utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the diagnosis of diabetes. In particular, we use an additional explanation module, which turns the “black box” model of an SVM into an intelligible representation of the SVM's diagnostic (classification) decision. Results on a real-life diabetes dataset show that intelligible SVMs provide a promising tool for the prediction of diabetes, where a comprehensible ruleset have been generated, with prediction accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 94%.

While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs.

Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.",2015,23,778,19,true,Computer Science,47793005,Junshui Ma,1838644,R.

This development should lead to sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as machine learning, have already been established in the industry to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.",2020,30,96,1,true,Engineering,77613442,R.

We exemplify this translation procedure for a new algorithm: one-class leveraging, starting from the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM). This is a first step toward unsupervised learning in a boosting framework. Building on so-called barrier methods known from the theory of constrained optimization, it returns a function, written as a convex combination of base hypotheses, that characterizes whether a given test point is likely to have been generated from the distribution underlying the training data. Simulations on one-class classification problems demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.",2002,77,252,19,false,Computer Science,2414086,G. Rätsch,2459012,S. Mika,,1707625,B.
