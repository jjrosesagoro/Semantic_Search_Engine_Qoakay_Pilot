Vast amount of such data are stored in different locations, on many different devices and in different data silos. Sharing data among different sources is a big challenge due to regulatory, operational and security reasons. One potential solution is federated machine learning, which is a method that sends machine learning algorithms simultaneously to all data sources, trains models in each source and aggregates the learned models. This strategy allows utilization of valuable data without moving them. One challenge in applying federated machine learning is the possibly different distributions of data from diverse sources. To tackle this problem, we proposed an adaptive boosting method named LoAdaBoost that increases the efficiency of federated machine learning. Using intensive care unit data from hospitals, we investigated the performance of learning in IID and non-IID data distribution scenarios, and showed that the proposed LoAdaBoost method achieved higher predictive accuracy with lower computational complexity than the baseline method.",2018,24,64,2,false,Computer Science,Medicine,2143702320,Li Huang,1640266327,Yifeng Yin,2068057580,Z.

Open problems surveyed in this research proposal include: How can we train reinforcement learners to take actions that are more amenable to meaningful assessment by intelligent overseers?

Machine learning techniques are playing key roles in this field. Typically, predictors based on machine learning techniques contain three main steps: feature extraction, predictor construction and performance evaluation. Although several Web servers and stand-alone tools have been developed to facilitate the biological sequence analysis, they only focus on individual step. In this regard, in this study a powerful Web server called BioSeq-Analysis (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/) has been proposed to automatically complete the three main steps for constructing a predictor. The user only needs to upload the benchmark data set. BioSeq-Analysis can generate the optimized predictor based on the benchmark data set, and the performance measures can be reported as well. Furthermore, to maximize user's convenience, its stand-alone program was also released, which can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/download/, and can be directly run on Windows, Linux and UNIX. Applied to three sequence analysis tasks, experimental results showed that the predictors generated by BioSeq-Analysis even outperformed some state-of-the-art methods.

One approach circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains. Our novel architecture results in a model that outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and additionally produces visualizations of the private and shared representations enabling interpretation of the domain adaptation process.",2016,34,1045,122,false,Computer Science,,2732737,Konstantinos Bousmalis,2814229,George Trigeorgis,2286640,N.

Products today are built with machine intelligence as a central attribute, and consumers are beginning to expect near-human interaction with the appliances they use. However, much of the deep learning revolution has been limited to the cloud. Recently, several machine learning packages based on edge devices have been announced which aim to offload the computing to the edges. However, little research has been done to evaluate these packages on the edges, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we make a performance comparison of several state-of-the-art machine learning packages on the edges, including TensorFlow, Caffe2, MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow Lite. We focus on evaluating the latency, memory footprint, and energy of these tools with two popular types of neural networks on different edge devices.

Such learning approaches are useful for many interesting real-world applications, but particularly shine for tasks involving the automatic organization, extraction, and retrieval of information from large collections of data (e.g., text, images, and other digital media). 
In traditional supervised learning, one uses ""labeled"" training data to induce a model. However, labeled instances for real-world applications are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain. Consider a complex task such as extracting key person and organization names from text documents. While gathering large amounts of unlabeled documents for these tasks is often relatively easy (e.g., from the World Wide Web), labeling these texts usually requires experienced human annotators with specific domain knowledge and training. There are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. This is especially true for applications that involve learning from instances with complex structures, which can require labels at varying levels of granularity. 
Active learning addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the learner to selectively choose which parts of the available data are labeled for training. The goal is to maximize the accuracy of the learner through such ""queries,"" while minimizing the work required of human annotators. In this thesis, I explore several important questions regarding active learning for these and similar tasks involving structured instances. What query strategies are available for these learning algorithms, and how do they compare? How might a learner pose queries at different levels of granularity, as with multiple-instance learning? Are there relationships between certain properties of a query and its difficulty for the annotator? If so, can these relationships be learned and exploited during active learning? The answers to the questions illustrate the utility and promise of active learning algorithms in complex real-world learning systems.",2008,157,52,5,false,Computer Science,,144557047,M.

Past research focused on analyzing traffic on the destination (victim's) side with predefined thresholds. These approaches have significant disadvantages. They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network. We evaluate nine machine learning algorithms and carefully compare their performance. Our experimental results show that more than 99.7% of four kinds of DOS attacks are successfully detected.

In such cases, learning algorithms may have to cope with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the issue of handling malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution, we analyze the performance of a particular method--online centroid anomaly detection--in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efficiency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker's full or limited control over the traffic and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation, carried out on real traces of HTTP and exploit traffic, confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and the practicality of our protection mechanisms.",2010,69,96,5,false,Mathematics,Computer Science,2749512,M.

Machine learning methods may excel at finding new features or nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as handling settings with more predictor variables than observations. However, the usefulness of both these data and machine learning has varied. Electronic health data often have quality issues (eg, missingness, misclassification, measurement error), and machine learning may perform similarly to standard techniques for some research questions. Ensembles (running multiple algorithms and either selecting the single best algorithm or creating a weighted average) can help mitigate the latter concern. Using several machine learning tools, Wong et al1 predicted delirium risk for newly hospitalized patients with high-dimensional electronic health record data at a large academic health institution. They compared these approaches with a questionnaire-based scoring system and found improved performance for machine learning with respect to several metrics calculated in a single holdout sample. Their article is a step toward updating delirium risk prediction. It also provides an opportunity to discuss 2 key issues in the current state of machine learning for prediction in electronic health data: evaluation and generalizability. The machine learning researchers who develop novel algorithms for prediction and the clinical teams interested in implementing them are frequently and unfortunately 2 nonintersecting groups. Thus, these algorithms may originally be built and evaluated in the machine learning literature based on metrics that are less clinically useful than other choices. Computer scientists and statisticians may optimize to achieve the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), but what a clinical team might need is high sensitivity or positive predictive value. Worse yet, algorithms can have misleading performance when evaluated only along 1 or 2 dimensions. For example, high AUC, accuracy, and positive predictive values can be accompanied by near-zero levels of sensitivity and specificity. It can also be essential to calculate metrics like the percentage of true cases in the top risk percentile.2 This is especially important when a goal of the tool is to target high-risk patients for interventions. Wong and colleagues1 helpfully compute AUC, positive predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. However, one accepted standard for evaluation that should be adopted in future clinical machine learning applications is K-fold cross-validation (eg, with K = 10) rather than the single holdout validation sample in their article. K-fold cross-validation involves K successive mutually exclusive validation sets where the algorithm fitting is iteratively performed on the nonvalidation data (ie, training set). At the end, each observation in the full data has a predicted value that was obtained from when it was part of a validation set. Typically, metrics calculated based on these K-fold cross-validated predicted values will more effectively assess overfitting and have lower variance.3 Of course, assessing the generalizability of a prediction algorithm goes well beyond using crossvalidated metrics to evaluate overfitting. Wong et al1 carefully discussed a number of limitations in their work, including the lack of external validation in other health systems. As in similar studies, the step from good performance in the study to a generalizable algorithm is vast and sometimes may not be feasible. Patients receiving treatment in varied care settings or geographic regions simply may require tailored tools. Recognizing the need for unique tools in different populations is not inherently negative, but one of many considerations not magically solved by using machine learning. Even those algorithms that prove to be generalizable may quickly become outdated as treatment patterns or physician incentives to code health conditions change.4 Increased social tolerance for certain + Related article",2018,11,54,1,true,Computer Science,Medicine,48345067,Sherri Rose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects.

The fault detection in WSNs is a challenging problem due to sensor resources limitation and the variety of deployment field. Furthermore, the detection has to be precise to avoid negative alerts, and rapid to limit loss. The use of machine learning seems to be one of the most convenient solutions for detecting failure in WSNs. In this paper, support vector machines (SVMs) classification method is used for this purpose. Based on statistical learning theory, SVM is used in our context to define a decision function. As a light process in term of required resources, this decision function can be easily executed at cluster heads to detect anomalous sensor.

Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.",2018,65,574,131,true,Computer Science,Mathematics,3156540,Daniel Zügner,46256784,Amir Akbarnejad,3075189,Stephan Günnemann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core idea is to enlarge the distance between different classes under the conceptual framework of LSR. First, a technique called ε-dragging is introduced to force the regression targets of different classes moving along opposite directions such that the distances between classes can be enlarged. Then, the ε-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of L2,1 norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection. The model for multiclass classification and its extension for feature selection are finally solved elegantly and efficiently.

Ideally, a machine learning algorithm should make a prediction only when it is highly certain about its competency, and refer the case to physicians otherwise. In this paper, we investigate how Bayesian deep learning can improve the performance of the machine–physician team in the skin lesion classification task. We used the publicly available HAM10000 dataset, which includes samples from seven common skin lesion categories: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic Nevi (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC), Benign Keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), and Vascular (VASC) lesions. Our experimental results show that Bayesian deep networks can boost the diagnostic performance of the standard DenseNet-169 model from 81.35% to 83.59% without incurring additional parameters or heavy computation. More importantly, a hybrid physician–machine workflow reaches a classification accuracy of 90% while only referring 35% of the cases to physicians.

Being more specific, the authors have focused on various inference paradigms developed within a framework of the computational learning theory. The content in the book, as stated by authors, encompasses ideas, experience and experiments developed throughout the life of the Laboratory for Neural Networks, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. The volume is structured into five chapters. The first one titled “Knowledge versus randomness” addresses an important and practically relevant question of relationships between these two concepts and demonstrates how probabilistic models help capture and quantify randomness. Most of this chapter serves as a solid prerequisite to the rest of the book by covering the fundamentals of calculus of random variables. The next chapter focuses on mechanisms of algorithmic inferences realized in the statistical setting. The reader finds here ideas of sufficient statistics, confidence intervals, adequacy of sample size, point estimators, and issues of entropy. The first two chapters naturally form the introductory part of the book as dealing with the foundations of the subject. The second part is about the applications of machine learning and consists of three comprehensive chapters: on computational learning theory, regression theory, and subsymbolic learning. This combination very much reflects the main directions of the key developments encountered in machine learning. Chapter 3 is devoted to computational learning and includes its core concepts. Learning Boolean functions along with their well known probably approximately correct (PAC) principle occupies a prominent position in the theory and the same becomes true in this chapter. A lot of attention is paid to computing the hypotheses, confidence intervals for learning errors, high level abstraction and learnability. The chapter on regression theory (Chapter 4) is quite extensive and includes aspects of linear and nonlinear regression, PAC learning of regression functions, point estimators and confidence intervals. When looking at neural networks (the subject covered in a number of sections of the book), it is worth stressing that this material is nicely cast in the framework of the general learning theory. I would say this is a quite inspiring environment that is both useful and appealing to newcomers to the area of neurocomputing as well as those very much versatile in learning algorithms of neural networks. Neural networks dominate a chapter on subsymbolic learning (Chapter 5 of the book). Here the authors cover a generic taxonomy of the networks, elaborate on various learning strategies (cast in the setting of machine learning) and tackle the subject of learning without supervision (self associative memories and self-organizing memories/maps). Some of the topics that deliver another look at neural networks concern networks and data compression (the compression relates to the idea of Kolgomorov complexity), sufficient statistics, and stochastic facets of learning mechanisms. A comprehensive, well-organized and carefully compiled bibliography is an asset of the book; one can find here entries to classic texts in statistics, probability, learning theory, fuzzy sets, granular computing, and neural networks.

Learning this structure has the potential for not only improving the prediction performance, but also revealing important dependency patterns in the data. For example, given a meteorological dataset, we could identify regional weather patterns. In this work, we propose a new class of RTRBM, which we refer to as the structured RTRBM (SRTRBM), which explicitly uses a graph to model the dependency structure. Our technique is related to methods such as graphical lasso, which are used to learn the topology of Gaussian graphical models. We also develop a spike-and-slab version of the RTRBM, and combine it with the SRTRBM to learn dependency structures in datasets with real-valued observations.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection.",2017,49,59,3,false,Computer Science,,3422165,Elaheh Raisi,40486307,Bert Huang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information such as continuous proximity, location, communication and activity data, has been gathered from the phones of 100 human subjects at MIT. Systematic measurements from these 100 people over the course of eight months have generated one of the largest datasets of continuous human behavior ever collected, representing over 300,000 hours of daily activity. In this thesis we describe how this data can be used to uncover regular rules and structure in behavior of both individuals and organizations, infer relationships between subjects, verify selfreport survey data, and study social network dynamics. By combining theoretical models with rich and systematic measurements, we show it is possible to gain insight into the underlying behavior of complex social systems. Thesis Supervisor: Alex P.

Current approaches for solving this problem include model explanation, outcome explanation as well as model inspection. While these techniques can be beneficial by providing interpretability, they can be used in a negative manner to perform fairwashing, which we define as promoting the false perception that a machine learning model respects some ethical values. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to systematically rationalize decisions taken by an unfair black-box model using the model explanation as well as the outcome explanation approaches with a given fairness metric. Our solution, LaundryML, is based on a regularized rule list enumeration algorithm whose objective is to search for fair rule lists approximating an unfair black-box model. We empirically evaluate our rationalization technique on black-box models trained on real-world datasets and show that one can obtain rule lists with high fidelity to the black-box model while being considerably less unfair at the same time.",2019,40,79,1,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,40907220,U.

To address this, we introduce ADAHESSIAN, a new stochastic optimization algorithm. ADAHESSIAN directly incorporates approximate curvature information from the loss function, and it includes several novel performance-improving features, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a spatial averaging to reduce the variance of the second derivative; and (iii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the second-derivative across different iterations. We perform extensive tests on NLP, CV, and recommendation system tasks, and ADAHESSIAN achieves state-of-the-art results. In particular, we find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) outperforms AdamW for transformers by0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14, 2.7/1.0 PPLon PTB/Wikitext-103; (ii) outperforms AdamW for Squeeze-Bert by 0.41 points on GLUE; (iii) achieves 1.45%/5.55%higher accuracy on ResNet32/ResNet18 on Cifar10/ImageNetas compared to Adam; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset. The cost per iteration of ADAHESSIANis comparable to first-order methods, and ADAHESSIAN exhibits improved robustness towards variations in hyperparameter values.

The bottleneck in understanding how the brain works is consequently shifting away from the amount and type of data we can collect and toward what we actually do with the data. There has been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data across levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental paradigms to gain more insight into brain function. Such efforts are visible at an international scale, with the emergence of big data neuroscience initiatives, such as the BRAIN initiative (Bargmann et al., 2014), the Human Brain Project, the Human Connectome Project, and the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative. With these large-scale projects, much thought has been given to data-sharing across groups (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014; Sejnowski et al., 2014); however, even with such data-sharing initiatives, funding mechanisms, and infrastructure, there still exists the challenge of how to cohesively integrate all the data.

As a result, a single solution that is optimal for all tasks rarely exists. Recent papers introduced the concept of Pareto optimality to this field and directly cast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization problems, but solutions returned by existing methods are typically finite, sparse, and discrete. We present a novel, efficient method that generates locally continuous Pareto sets and Pareto fronts, which opens up the possibility of continuous analysis of Pareto optimal solutions in machine learning problems. We scale up theoretical results in multi-objective optimization to modern machine learning problems by proposing a sample-based sparse linear system, for which standard Hessian-free solvers in machine learning can be applied. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate its usage of analyzing local Pareto sets on various multi-task classification and regression problems. The experimental results confirm that our algorithm reveals the primary directions in local Pareto sets for trade-off balancing, finds more solutions with different trade-offs efficiently, and scales well to tasks with millions of parameters.",2020,15,33,6,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,12558026,Pingchuan Ma,2056897446,Tao Du,1752521,W.

With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this work, we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. By using those properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on 4 real world datasets.

In particular, supervised machine learning has been used to great effect in numerous bioinformatics prediction methods. Through many years of editing and reviewing manuscripts, we noticed that some supervised machine learning techniques seem to be gaining in popularity while others seemed, at least to our eyes, to be looking ‘unfashionable’. 
 
We were motivated to create a league table of machine learning techniques to learn what is hot and what is not in the machine learning field. In this editorial, we only include those that we considered major league and leave analysis of the minor league methods as an exercise for the interested reader. To create our league table, we created a list of supervised machine learning techniques commonly used in bioinformatics and their common synonyms, plural forms and abbreviations. We then searched this list against the PubMed titles and abstracts to identify the number of papers published per year for each machine learning technique. To match as many papers as possible, searches were case insensitive and allowed for variation in hyphenation. 
 
To our surprise, the artificial neural network (ANN) is not only the dominant league leader in 2011 but has been in this position since at least the 1970s (see Fig. 1). However, in recent years the usage of support vector machines (SVMs) grew tremendously, and we predict that SVMs will challenge ANNs for the dominant position in the coming decade. Since 2007 the number of publications using ANNs has decreased by 21%, which we hypothesize may be directly attributed to researchers increasingly using SVMs in place of ANNs. SVMs caught up with and overtook Markov models in 2004 to gain second spot in our machine learning league. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. 
 
The growth of supervised machine learning methods in PubMed. 
 
 
 
As for the question of ‘what is hot?’, one can see that Random forests are a rapidly growing method with not a single mention of them before 2003 and now a total of 407 papers published to date. 
 
We were hoping to find techniques that were not so hot and perhaps going out of fashion. The results show that none of the major league methods has gone out of fashion, but we do see moderate decreases in the use of both ANNs and Markov models in the literature. 
 
We were also curious to find out if certain machine learning techniques were used in combination with each other. To investigate this, we looked at what machine learning methods are co-mentioned in articles (See Fig. 2). For all pairs of methods from the Supervised Machine Learning Top-5, we counted the number of abstracts that mention both methods and normalized the counts with the number of co-occurrences that would be expected by chance (based on the frequencies with which the methods are mentioned over the years). The strongest correlation (185 times higher than random expectation) is seen between decision trees and random forests, which is to be expected as random forests are ensembles of decision trees. Apart from this, the next strongest correlation (88 times higher than random expectation) is found between the two newest methods on the list, namely SVMs and random forests. We hypothesize that this is due to many researchers using these algorithms through machine learning frameworks such as Weka (Frank et al., 2004), which allows many different algorithms to easily be applied to the same dataset.

Applications of supervised machine learning methodology continue to grow in the biomedical literature. Despite new methods growing in usage, for example support vector machines and random forests, we see little evidence that any widely adopted methods are falling out of use.

They show how some distinct choice of human behavior or preference influences a decision. They are also used to project future demand estimates to support policy exploration. This latter use for prediction is indirectly aligned with and conditional to the model's estimation which aims to fit the observed data. In contrast, machine learning models are derived to maximize prediction accuracy through mechanisms such as out-of-sample validation, non-linear structure, and automated covariate selection, albeit at the expense of interpretability and sound behavioral theory. We investigate how machine learning models can outperform discrete choice models for prediction of car ownership using transportation household survey data from Singapore. We compare our household car ownership model (multinomial logit model) against various machine learning models (e.g. Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) by using 2008 data to derive, i.e. estimate models that we then use to predict 2012 ownership. The machine learning models are inferior to the discrete choice model when using discrete choice features. However, after engineering features more appropriate for machine learning they are superior. These results highlight both the cost of applying machine learning models in econometric contexts and an opportunity for improved prediction and better urban policy making through machine learning models with appropriate features.",2017,13,39,3,false,Engineering,Computer Science,144081101,Miguel Paredes,1807219,Erik Hemberg,1398192342,Una-May O’Reilly,97735715,C.

We improve the uniform error bound of that paper, as well as giving novel understandings of the embedding's variance, approximation error, and use in some machine learning methods. We also point out that surprisingly, of the two main variants of those features, the more widely used is strictly higher-variance for the Gaussian kernel and has worse bounds.",2015,33,148,15,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,36326783,Danica J.

However, due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent, i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a particular classification or recognition decision, given a new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the “importance” of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this paper, we present a general methodology based on region perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical implications.

However, some special kinds of domain adaptation problems have been studied before under different names such as class imbalance [Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002], covariate shift [Shimodaira, 2000], and sample selection bias [Heckman, 1979]. There are also some well-studied machine learning problems that are closely related but not equivalent to domain adaptation, including multi-task learning [Caruana, 1997] and semi-supervised learning [Chapelle et al., 2006]. In this literature survey, we review existing work in both the machine learning and the natural language processing communities related to domain adaptation. Because this relatively new topic is constantly attracting attention, our survey is necessarily incomplete. Nevertheless, we try to cover the major lines of work that we are aware of up to the date this survey is written. This survey will also be constantly updated. The goal of this literature survey is twofold. First, existing studies on domain adaptation seem very different from each other, and different terms are used to refer to the problem. There has not been any survey that connects these different studies. This survey thus tries to organize the existing work in a systematic way and draw a big picture of the domain adaptation problem with its possible solutions.

The declarative specification of ML algorithms enables---in contrast to existing large-scale machine learning libraries---automatic optimization. SystemML's primary focus is on data parallelism but many ML algorithms inherently exhibit opportunities for task parallelism as well. A major challenge is how to efficiently combine both types of parallelism for arbitrary ML scripts and workloads. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for combining task and data parallelism for large-scale machine learning on top of MapReduce. We employ a generic Parallel FOR construct (ParFOR) as known from high performance computing (HPC). Our core contributions are (1) complementary parallelization strategies for exploiting multi-core and cluster parallelism, as well as (2) a novel cost-based optimization framework for automatically creating optimal parallel execution plans. Experiments on a variety of use cases showed that this achieves both efficiency and scalability due to automatic adaptation to ad-hoc workloads and unknown data characteristics.",2014,37,91,9,true,Computer Science,,40237241,Matthias Boehm,1947100,S.

Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n = 34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n = 12), hospital length of stay (n = 7), hospital admission/triage (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 4), life-saving interventions (n = 5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 4), and transfusion (n = 1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma. However, the impact of ML will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance criteria, and high-quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts before ML can be widely accepted in practice.",2017,79,62,0,false,Medicine,,2359238,Nehemiah T.

To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",2019,100,102,3,true,Computer Science,,2405396,Ehsan Toreini,47301404,M.

Machine learning methods are renowned for dealing with these problems. To date machine learning methods have been applied in Genome-Wide Association Studies for identification of candidate genes, epistasis detection, gene network pathway analyses and genomic prediction of phenotypic values. However, the utility of two machine learning methods, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Method (XgBoost), in identifying a subset of SNP makers for genomic prediction of breeding values has never been explored before. In this study, using 38,082 SNP markers and body weight phenotypes from 2,093 Brahman cattle (1,097 bulls as a discovery population and 996 cows as a validation population), we examined the efficiency of three machine learning methods, namely Random Forests (RF), GBM and XgBoost, in (a) the identification of top 400, 1,000, and 3,000 ranked SNPs; (b) using the subsets of SNPs to construct genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) for the estimation of genomic breeding values (GEBVs). For comparison purposes, we also calculated the GEBVs from (1) 400, 1,000, and 3,000 SNPs that were randomly selected and evenly spaced across the genome, and (2) from all the SNPs. We found that RF and especially GBM are efficient methods in identifying a subset of SNPs with direct links to candidate genes affecting the growth trait. In comparison to the estimate of prediction accuracy of GEBVs from using all SNPs (0.43), the 3,000 top SNPs identified by RF (0.42) and GBM (0.46) had similar values to those of the whole SNP panel. The performance of the subsets of SNPs from RF and GBM was substantially better than that of evenly spaced subsets across the genome (0.18–0.29). Of the three methods, RF and GBM consistently outperformed the XgBoost in genomic prediction accuracy.",2018,96,79,5,true,Medicine,Biology,2165243599,Bo Li,8388007,Nanxi Zhang,87041990,You‐Gan Wang,2057470473,A.

In recent years, deep learning (DL), a rebranding of neural networks (NNs), has risen to the top in numerous areas, namely computer vision (CV), speech recognition, and natural language processing. Whereas remote sensing (RS) possesses a number of unique challenges, primarily related to sensors and applications, inevitably RS draws from many of the same theories as CV, e.g., statistics, fusion, and machine learning, to name a few. This means that the RS community should not only be aware of advancements such as DL, but also be leading researchers in this area. Herein, we provide the most comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art RS DL research. We also review recent new developments in the DL field that can be used in DL for RS. Namely, we focus on theories, tools, and challenges for the RS community. Specifically, we focus on unsolved challenges and opportunities as they relate to (i) inadequate data sets, (ii) human-understandable solutions for modeling physical phenomena, (iii) big data, (iv) nontraditional heterogeneous data sources, (v) DL architectures and learning algorithms for spectral, spatial, and temporal data, (vi) transfer learning, (vii) an improved theoretical understanding of DL systems, (viii) high barriers to entry, and (ix) training and optimizing the DL.",2017,417,390,14,true,Computer Science,Engineering,145672842,J.

This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate distribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$ is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is $\mu$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $\mu / \sqrt{n}$. 
The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector $X$, which can contain $k \leq c \min(\sqrt{n}/\mu \log n, m^{1/2 -\eta})$ non-zero entries (for any $\eta > 0$). This is close to the best $k$ allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the dictionary $A$ exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on $\log 1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on $1/\epsilon$, and this is necessary.",2013,63,200,21,false,Computer Science,Mathematics,145563465,Sanjeev Arora,144804200,Rong Ge,1690962,Ankur Moitra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crop discrimination via remote sensing is a complex task, especially if different crops have a similar spectral response and cropping pattern. In such cases, crop identification could be improved by combining object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods. In this investigation, we evaluated the C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network methods, both as single classifiers and combined in a hierarchical classification, for the mapping of nine major summer crops (both woody and herbaceous) from ASTER satellite images captured in two different dates. Each method was built with different combinations of spectral and textural features obtained after the segmentation of the remote images in an object-based framework. As single classifiers, MLP and SVM obtained maximum overall accuracy of 88%, slightly higher than LR (86%) and notably higher than C4.5 (79%). The SVM+SVM classifier (best method) improved these results to 89%. In most cases, the hierarchical classifiers considerably increased the accuracy of the most poorly classified class (minimum sensitivity). The SVM+SVM method offered a significant improvement in classification accuracy for all of the studied crops compared to the conventional decision tree classifier, ranging between 4% for safflower and 29% for corn, which suggests the application of object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods in complex crop classification tasks.",2014,57,137,4,true,Computer Science,,145147081,J.

We pose the task of learning RMs as a discrete optimization problem where the objective is to find an RM that decomposes the problem into a set of subproblems such that the combination of their optimal memoryless policies is an optimal policy for the original problem.

The standard way of diagnosing malaria is by visually examining blood smears for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by qualified technicians. This method is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and the knowledge of the person doing the examination. Automatic image recognition technologies based on machine learning have been applied to malaria blood smears for diagnosis before. However, the practical performance has not been sufficient so far. This study proposes a new and robust machine learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify single cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides as either infected or uninfected.

Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. While each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. More formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags X1, ..., Xm, with Xj = {xi : i ∈ Ij} and Ij ⊆ {1, ..., n}. With each bag Xj is associated a label Yj ∈ {−1, 1}. These labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label Yj = −1, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. If on the other hand, Yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi ∈ Xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. The MIL scenario has many interesting applications: One prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (Dietterich, Lathrop, & LozanoPerez 1997). Here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. Another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (Maron & Ratan 1998) or image regions. Algorithms for the MIL problem were first presented in (Dietterich, Lathrop, & Lozano-Perez 1997; Auer 1997; Long & Tan 1996). These methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. Similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (Maron & Lozano-Perez 1998; Zhang & Goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting). A notable exception is (Ramon & Raedt 2000).",2002,12,113,18,false,Computer Science,,2054883307,Stuart Andrews,143936663,Thomas Hofmann,1765700,Ioannis Tsochantaridis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They play an important role in regulating gene transcription and the regulation of normal development. MicroRNAs can be associated with disease; however, only a few microRNA-disease associations have been confirmed by traditional experimental approaches. We introduce two methods to predict microRNA-disease association. The first method, KATZ, focuses on integrating the social network analysis method with machine learning and is based on networks derived from known microRNA-disease associations, disease-disease associations, and microRNA-microRNA associations. The other method, CATAPULT, is a supervised machine learning method. We applied the two methods to 242 known microRNA-disease associations and evaluated their performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation. Experiments proved that our methods outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.",2015,67,144,2,true,Biology,Medicine,144268946,Q.

Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance.",2008,32,164,16,false,Computer Science,Medicine,39533001,Wei Wu,1782783,Xiaorong Gao,145031714,Bo Hong,145834126,Shangkai Gao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real‐world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to‐date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.",2021,239,68,2,false,Medicine,,6609752,A.

Although classical machine learning techniques have successfully been applied to find informative genes and to predict class labels for new samples, common restrictions of microarray analysis such as small sample sizes, a large attribute space and high noise levels still limit its scientific and clinical applications. Increasing the interpretability of prediction models while retaining a high accuracy would help to exploit the information content in microarray data more effectively. For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification. A comparison with other benchmark microarray sample classifiers based on three diverse feature selection algorithms suggests that these evolutionary learning techniques can compete with state-of-the-art methods like support vector machines. The obtained models reach accuracies above 90% in two-level external cross-validation, with the added value of facilitating interpretation by using only combinations of simple if-then-else rules. As a further benefit, a literature mining analysis reveals that prioritizations of informative genes extracted from BioHEL’s classification rule sets can outperform gene rankings obtained from a conventional ensemble feature selection in terms of the pointwise mutual information between relevant disease terms and the standardized names of top-ranked genes.",2012,152,107,3,true,Biology,Medicine,1806197,E.
