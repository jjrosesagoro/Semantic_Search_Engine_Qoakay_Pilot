Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data. 
 
The history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique [1] for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences [2] employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) [3] and neocognitron [4] were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data. 
 
This tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed. Finally, a section reviews methods and examples as implemented in the open source data analysis and visualization language R (http://www.r-project.org).",2007,50,482,19,true,Computer Science,Medicine,2490889,A.

We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis. We also explored feature selection techniques, including the use of AdaBoost for feature selection prior to classification by SVM or LDA. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost followed by classification with support vector machines. The system operates in real-time, and obtained 93% correct generalization to novel subjects for a 7-way forced choice on the Cohn-Kanade expression dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics. We applied the system to to fully automated recognition of facial actions (FACS). The present system classifies 17 action units, whether they occur singly or in combination with other actions, with a mean accuracy of 94.8%.

Overview Dataset shift is a challenging situation where the joint distribution of inputs and outputs differs between the training and test stages. Covariate shift is a simpler particular case of dataset shift where only the input distribution changes (covariate denotes input), while the conditional distribution of the outputs given the inputs p(y|x) remains unchanged. Dataset shift is present in most practical applications for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by experimental design, to the mere irreproducibility of the testing conditions at training time. For example, in an image classification task, training data might have been recorded under controlled laboratory conditions, whereas the test data may show different lighting conditions. In other applications, the process that generates data is in itself adaptive. Some of our authors consider the problem of spam email filtering: successful "" spammers "" will try to build spam in a form that differs from the spam the automatic filter has been built on. Dataset shift seems to have raised relatively little interest in the machine learning community until very recently. Indeed, many machine learning algorithms are based on the assumption that the training data is drawn from exactly the same distribution as the test data on which the model will later be evaluated. Semi-supervised learning and active learning, two problems that seem very similar to covariate shift have received much more attention. How do they differ from covariate shift? Semi-supervised learning is designed to take advantage of unlabeled data present at training time, but is not conceived to be robust against changes in the input distribution. In fact, one can easily construct examples of covariate shift for which common SSL strategies such as the "" cluster assumption "" will lead to disaster. In active learning the algorithm is asked to select from the available unlabeled inputs those for which obtaining the label will be most beneficial for learning. This is very relevant in contexts where labeling data is very costly, but active learning strategies 2 Contents are not specifically design for dealing with covariate shift. This book attempts to give an overview of the different recent efforts that are being …",1998,884,875,24,false,Computer Science,,144299726,Thomas G. Dietterich,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The essential idea of ADASYN is to use a weighted distribution for different minority class examples according to their level of difficulty in learning, where more synthetic data is generated for minority class examples that are harder to learn compared to those minority examples that are easier to learn. As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples. Simulation analyses on several machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of this method across five evaluation metrics.",2008,34,2395,333,true,Computer Science,,2198278,Haibo He,2115297828,Yang Bai,2111388466,E.

An active learner may pose ""queries,"" usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an ""oracle"" (e.g., a human annotator) that already understands the nature of the problem. This sort of approach is well-motivated in many modern machine learning and data mining applications, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easy to come by, but training labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This book is a general introduction to active learning. It outlines several scenarios in which queries might be formulated, and details many query selection algorithms which have been organized into four broad categories, or ""query selection frameworks."" We also touch on some of the theoretical foundations of active learning, and conclude with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in practice, including a summary of ongoing work to address these open challenges and opportunities.",2012,86,790,60,false,Computer Science,,1717452,Burr Settles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, most cognitive radio research has focused on policy-based radios that are hard-coded with a list of rules on how the radio should behave in certain scenarios. Some work has been done on radios with learning engines tailored for very specific applications. This article describes a concrete model for a generic cognitive radio to utilize a learning engine. The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful. We describe how our generic cognitive engine can tackle problems such as capacity maximization and dynamic spectrum access.",2007,17,317,11,false,Computer Science,,144047524,T.

At the same time, the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model.

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.",2002,35,2517,281,false,Mathematics,Computer Science,1725533,G.

We are given a labeled training set of input-output pairs, D = (xi, yi)i=1, and have to learn a way to predict the output or target ỹ for a novel test input x̃ (i.e, for x̃ 6∈ D). (We use the tilde notation to denote test cases that we have not seen before.) Some examples include: predicting if someone has cancer ỹ ∈ {0, 1} given some measured variables x̃; predicting the stock price tomorrow ỹ ∈ IR given the stock prices today x̃; etc. A common approach is to just predict one’s “best guess”, such as ŷ(x̃). However, we prefer to compute a probability distribution over the output, p(ỹ|x̃), since it is very useful to have a measure of confidence associated with one’s prediction, especially in medical and financial domains. In addition, probabilistic methods are essential for unsupervised learning, as we discuss in Section 3. If y is discrete or categorical, say y ∈ {1, 2, . . . , C}, this problem is called classification or pattern recognition. If there are C = 2 classes or labels, the problem is called binary classification (see Figure 1 for an example), otherwise it is called multi-class classification. We usually assume the classes are mutually exclusive, so y can only be in one possible state. If we want to allow multiple labels, we can represent y by a bit-vector of length C, so yj = 1 if y belongs to class j. If y is continuous, say y ∈ IR, this problem is called regression. If y is multidimensional, say y ∈ IR , we call it multivariate regression. If y is discrete, but ordered (e.g., y ∈ {low,medium,high}), the problem is called ordinal regression. A priori, our prediction might be quite poor, but we are provided with a labeled training set of input-output pairs, D = (xi, yi) n i=1, which provides a set of examples of the “right response” for a set of possible inputs.

This, however, is at the cost of large numbers of evaluations of the program. This paper develops a new methodology to reduce this number and hence speed up iterative optimization. It uses predictive modelling from the domain of machine learning to automatically focus search on those areas likely to give greatest performance. This approach is independent of search algorithm, search space or compiler infrastructure and scales gracefully with the compiler optimization space size. Off-line, a training set of programs is iteratively evaluated and the shape of the spaces and program features are modelled. These models are learnt and used to focus the iterative optimization of a new program. We evaluate two learnt models, an independent and Markov model, and evaluate their worth on two embedded platforms, the Texas Instrument C67I3 and the AMD Au1500. We show that such learnt models can speed up iterative search on large spaces by an order of magnitude. This translates into an average speedup of 1.22 on the TI C6713 and 1.27 on the AMD Au1500 in just 2 evaluations.",2006,20,450,31,false,Computer Science,,3288675,F. Agakov,30561807,Edwin V.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging.

Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies.",2007,37,322,9,false,Mathematics,Medicine,144789804,K.

We describe this problem in terms of heuristic search through a space of feature sets, and we identify four dimensions along which approaches to the problem can vary. We consider recent work on feature selection in terms of this framework, then close with some challenges for future work in the area. 1. The Problem of Irrelevant Features accuracy) to grow slowly with the number of irrele- vant attributes. Theoretical results for algorithms that search restricted hypothesis spaces are encouraging. For instance, the worst-case number of errors made by Littlestone's (1987) WINNOW method grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant features. Pazzani and Sarrett's (1992) average-case analysis for WHOLIST, a simple conjunctive algorithm, and Lang- ley and Iba's (1993) treatment of the naive Bayesian classifier, suggest that their sample complexities grow at most linearly with the number of irrelevant features. However, the theoretical results are less optimistic for induction methods that search a larger space of concept descriptions. For example, Langley and Iba's (1993) average-case analysis of simple nearest neighbor indicates that its sample complexity grows exponen- tially with the number of irrelevant attributes, even for conjunctive target concepts. Experimental stud- ies of nearest neighbor are consistent with this conclu- sion, and other experiments suggest that similar results hold even for induction algorithms that explicitly se- lect features. For example, the sample complexity for decision-tree methods appears to grow linearly with the number of irrelevants for conjunctive concepts, but exponentially for parity concepts, since the evaluation metric cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant fea- tures in the latter situation (Langley & Sage, in press). Results of this sort have encouraged machine learn- ing researchers to explore more sophisticated methods for selecting relevant features. In the sections that fol- low, we present a general framework for this task, and then consider some recent examples of work on this important problem.",1994,21,778,24,true,Mathematics,,1713919,P.

Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models.

In particular, it describes how submodular function minimization is equivalent to solving a wide variety of convex optimization problems. This allows the derivation of new efficient algorithms for approximate and exact submodular function minimization with theoretical guarantees and good practical performance. By listing many examples of submodular functions, it reviews various applications to machine learning, such as clustering, experimental design, sensor placement, graphical model structure learning or subset selection, as well as a family of structured sparsity-inducing norms that can be derived and used from submodular functions.

The removal of irrelevant and redundant information often improves the performance of machine learning algorithms. There are two common approaches: a wrapper uses the intended learning algorithm itself to evaluate the usefulness of features, while a fllter evaluates features according to heuristics based on general characteristics of the data. The wrapper approach is generally considered to produce better feature subsets but runs much more slowly than a fllter. This paper describes a new fllter approach to feature selection that uses a correlation based heuristic to evaluate the worth of feature subsets When applied as a data preprocessing step for two common machine learning algorithms, the new method compares favourably with the wrapper but requires much less computation.",1999,17,588,56,false,Computer Science,,118860642,M.

It establishes the idea that only those cells that recognize the antigens (Ag's) are selected to proliferate. The selected cells are subject to an affinity maturation process, which improves their affinity to the selective Ag's. This paper proposes a computational implementation of the clonal selection principle that explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The general algorithm, named CLONALG, is derived primarily to perform machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, and then it is adapted to solve optimization problems, emphasizing multimodal and combinatorial optimization. Two versions of the algorithm are derived, their computational cost per iteration is presented, and a sensitivity analysis in relation to the user-defined parameters is given.

As the base constituents of the ensemble are tree-structured predictors, and since each of these is constructed using an injection of randomness, the method is called ‘random forests’. That the exceptional performance is attained with seemingly only a single tuning parameter, to which sensitivity is minimal, makes the methodology all the more remarkable. The individual trees comprising the forest are all grown to maximal depth. While this helps with regard bias, there is the familiar tradeoff with variance. However, these variability concerns were potentially obscured because of an interesting feature of those benchmarking datasets extracted from the UCI machine learning repository for testing: all these datasets are hard to overfit using tree-structured methods. This raises issues about the scope of the repository. With this as motivation, and coupled with experience from boosting methods, we revisit the formulation of random forests and investigate prediction performance on real-world and simulated datasets for which maximally sized trees do overfit. These explorations reveal that gains can be realized by additional tuning to regulate tree size via limiting the number of splits and/or the size of nodes for which splitting is allowed. Nonetheless, even in these settings, good performance for random forests can be attained by using larger (than default) primary tuning parameter values.",2004,14,452,19,false,Computer Science,,3013332,M.

When applying machine learning, obtaining ground-truth labels for supervised learning is more difficult than in many more common applications of machine learning. This is especially so for datasets with abnormalities, as tissue types and the shapes of the organs in these datasets differ widely. However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier. A probabilistic patch-based method was employed for multiple organ detection, with the features learned from the deep learning model.

Traditionally, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) where all the data is unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm (e.g., classification, regression) where all the data is labeled.The goal of semi-supervised learning is to understand how combining labeled and unlabeled data may change the learning behavior, and design algorithms that take advantage of such a combination. Semi-supervised learning is of great interest in machine learning and data mining because it can use readily available unlabeled data to improve supervised learning tasks when the labeled data is scarce or expensive. Semi-supervised learning also shows potential as a quantitative tool to understand human category learning, where most of the input is self-evidently unlabeled. In this introductory book, we present some popular semi-supervised learning models, including self-training, mixture models, co-training and multiview learning, graph-based methods, and semi-supervised support vector machines. For each model, we discuss its basic mathematical formulation. The success of semi-supervised learning depends critically on some underlying assumptions. We emphasize the assumptions made by each model and give counterexamples when appropriate to demonstrate the limitations of the different models. In addition, we discuss semi-supervised learning for cognitive psychology. Finally, we give a computational learning theoretic perspective on semi-supervised learning, and we conclude the book with a brief discussion of open questions in the field.",2009,195,1849,109,true,Computer Science,,1832364,Xiaojin Zhu,2417893,A.

Unfortunately, their success is usually dependant on the quality of the data that they operate on. If the data is inadequate, or contains extraneous and irrelevant information, machine learning algorithms may produce less accurate and less understandable results, or may fail to discover anything of use at all. Feature subset selectors are algorithms that attempt to identify and remove as much irrelevant and redundant information as possible prior to learning. Feature subset selection can result in enhanced performance, a reduced hypothesis search space, and, in some cases, reduced storage requirement. This paper describes a new feature selection algorithm that uses a correlation based heuristic to determine the “goodness” of feature subsets, and evaluates its effectiveness with three common machine learning algorithms. Experiments using a number of standard machine learning data sets are presented. Feature subset selection gave significant improvement for all three algorithms.",1998,16,538,41,false,Computer Science,,118860642,M. Hall,2226870,L. A. Smith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other ""kernel machines"" popular in the community.

While significant progress has been made to improve learning in a single task, the idea of transfer learning has only recently been applied to reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea of transfer is that experience gained in learning to perform one task can help improve learning performance in a related, but different, task.

Underestimates lead to time pressures that may compromise full functional development and thorough testing of software. In contrast, overestimates can result in noncompetitive contract bids and/or over allocation of development resources and personnel. As a result, many models for estimating software development effort have been proposed. This article describes two methods of machine learning, which we use to build estimators of software development effort from historical data. Our experiments indicate that these techniques are competitive with traditional estimators on one dataset, but also illustrate that these methods are sensitive to the data on which they are trained. This cautionary note applies to any model-construction strategy that relies on historical data. All such models for software effort estimation should be evaluated by exploring model sensitivity on a variety of historical data. >",1995,19,541,24,false,Computer Science,,38402081,K.

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.

However, there is no general theory of machine learning metrics, that could answer questions such as: When we simultaneously want to optimise two criteria, how can or should they be traded off? Some metrics are inherently independent of class and misclassification cost distributions, while other are not -- can this be made more precise? This paper provides a derivation of ROC space from first principles through 3D ROC space and the skew ratio, and redefines metrics in these dimensions. The paper demonstrates that the graphical depiction of machine learning metrics by means of ROC isometrics gives many useful insights into the characteristics of these metrics, and provides a foundation on which a theory of machine learning metrics can be built.",2003,17,298,45,false,Computer Science,,47840704,Peter A.

In this paper, we look for tasks where machine learning algorithms are not as good as humans with the hope of gaining insight into their current limitations. We studied various Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) on the market, because they are systems designed to tell computers and humans apart by posing challenges presumably too hard for computers. We found that most HIPs are pure recognition tasks which can easily be broken using machine learning. The harder HIPs use a combination of segmentation and recognition tasks. From this observation, we found that building segmentation tasks is the most effective way to confuse machine learning algorithms. This has enabled us to build effective HIPs (which we deployed in MSN Passport), as well as design challenging segmentation tasks for machine learning algorithms.",2004,9,284,22,false,Computer Science,,1809791,K.

We show that many existing methods proposed for this task are simple applications or modifications of one or more standard machine learning methods for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation. We introduce new prediction methods in all of these classes. We introduce a new experimental procedure for testing stronger forms of generalization than has been used previously.

Each of these data sets has been previously analyzed and reported in the statistical, medical, or machine learning literature. The data sets are characterized by statisucal uncertainty; there is no completely accurate solution to these problems. Training and testing or resampling techniques are used to estimate the true error rates of the classification methods. Detailed attention is given to the analysis of performance of the neural nets using back propagation. For these problems, which have relatively few hypotheses and features, the machine learning procedures for rule induction or tree induction clearly performed best.",1989,40,531,16,false,Computer Science,,145700185,S.

The ability to learn is a fundamental characteristic of intelligent behavior. Consequently, machine learning has been a focus of artificial intelligence since the beginnings of AI in the 1950s. The 1980s saw tremendous growth in the field, and this growth promises to continue with valuable contributions to science, engineering, and business. 
 
Readings in Machine Learning collects the best of the published machine learning literature, including papers that address a wide range of learning tasks, and that introduce a variety of techniques for giving machines the ability to learn. The editors, in cooperation with a group of expert referees, have chosen important papers that empirically study, theoretically analyze, or psychologically justify machine learning algorithms. The papers are grouped into a dozen categories, each of which is introduced by the editors.",1991,0,378,8,false,Computer Science,,1734317,J. Shavlik,67136395,T. Deitterich,144299726,Thomas G.

For example, a learning system for medical diagnosis might be trained with examples of patients whose case records (medical tests, clinical observations) and diagnoses were known. The task of the learning system is to infer a function that predicts the diagnosis of a patient from his or her case records. The function to be learned might be represented as a set of rules, a decision tree, a Bayes network, or a neural network. Learning algorithms essentially operate by searching some space of functions (usually called the hypothesis class) for a function that fits the given data. Because there are usually exponentially many functions, this search cannot actually examine individual hypothesis functions but instead must use some more direct method of constructing the hypothesis functions from the data. This search can usually be formalized by defining an objective function (e.g., number of data points predicted incorrectly) and applying various algorithms to find a function that minimizes this objective function is NP-hard. For example, fitting the weights of a neural network or finding the smallest decision tree are both NP-complete problems [Blum and Rivest, 1989; Quinlan and Rivest 1989]. Hence, heuristic algorithms such as gradient descent (for neural networks) and greedy search (for decision trees) have been applied with great success. Of course, the suboptimality of such heuristic algorithms ~mmediately suggests a reas&able line of research: find ~lgorithms that can search the hypothesis class better. Hence, there has been extensive research in applying secondorder methods to fit neural networks and in conducting much more thorough searches in learning decision trees and rule sets. Ironically, when these algorithms were tested on real datasets, it was found that their performance was often worse than simrde szradient descent or greedy sear~h [&inlan and Cameron-Jones 1995; Weigend 1994]. In short: it appears to be bet~er not to optimize! One of the other important trends in machine-learning research has been the establishment and nurturing of connections between various previously disparate fields, including computational learning theory, connectionist learning, symbolic learning. and statistics. The . connection to statistics was crucial in resolvins$ this naradox. The-key p~oblem arises from the structure of the machine-learning task, A learning algorithm is trained on a set of training data, but then it is applied to make predictions on new data points. The goal is to maximize its predictive accuracy on the new data points—not necessarily its accuracy on the trammg data. Indeed, if we work too hard to find the very best fit to the training data, there is a risk that we will fit the noise in the data by memorizing various peculiarities",1995,8,465,11,false,Computer Science,,144299726,Thomas G.

We show how information extraction can be cast as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The implementation of a general-purpose relational learner for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document structure and the kinds of information available for use in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and other information is supplied as input in the form of an extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting of university course and research project pages sampled from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set.",1998,16,318,17,false,Computer Science,,1758106,D. Freitag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past decade, machine learning has evolved from a field of laboratory demonstrations to a field of significant commercial value. Machine-learning algorithms have now learned to detect credit card fraud by mining data on past transactions, learned to steer vehicles driving autonomously on public highways at 70 miles an hour, and learned the reading interests of many individuals to assemble personally customized electronic newsAbstracts. A new computational theory of learning is beginning to shed light on fundamental issues, such as the trade-off among the number of training examples available, the number of hypotheses considered, and the likely accuracy of the learned hypothesis. Newer research is beginning to explore issues such as long-term learning of new representations, the integration of Bayesian inference and induction, and life-long cumulative learning.
