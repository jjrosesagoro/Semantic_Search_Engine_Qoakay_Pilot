For ensembles where the individual estimators output crisp class labels, this 'diversity' is not well understood and remains an open research issue. For ensembles of regression estimators, the diversity can be exactly formulated in terms of the covariance between individual estimator outputs, and the optimum level is expressed in terms of a bias-variance-covariance trade-off. Despite this, most approaches to learning ensembles use heuristics to encourage the right degree of diversity. In this work we show how to explicitly control diversity through the error function. The first contribution of this paper is to show that by taking the combination mechanism for the ensemble into account we can derive an error function for each individual that balances ensemble diversity with individual accuracy. We show the relationship between this error function and an existing algorithm called negative correlation learning, which uses a heuristic penalty term added to the mean squared error function. It is demonstrated that these methods control the bias-variance-covariance trade-off systematically, and can be utilised with any estimator capable of minimising a quadratic error function, for example MLPs, or RBF networks. As a second contribution, we derive a strict upper bound on the coefficient of the penalty term, which holds for any estimator that can be cast in a generalised linear regression framework, with mild assumptions on the basis functions. Finally we present the results of an empirical study, showing significant improvements over simple ensemble learning, and finding that this technique is competitive with a variety of methods, including boosting, bagging, mixtures of experts, and Gaussian processes, on a number of tasks.",2005,28,341,32,false,Mathematics,145485821,Gavin Brown,1688492,J.

ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.",2020,280,77,1,true,Computer Science,1944467,Anja Thieme,145763736,D.

Recognizing the problem as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine learning community has developed the field of meta-learning, focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems. But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss the generalization of meta-learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction, and optimization, and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics, cryptography, and other fields.",2009,119,502,27,false,Computer Science,1398371449,K.

Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine).

By a divide-and-conquer approach, the algorithm partitions a data set into disjoint data subsets, applies the least squares regularization scheme to each data subset to produce an output function, and then takes an average of the individual output functions as a final global estimator or predictor. We show with error bounds in expectation in both the $L^2$-metric and RKHS-metric that the global output function of this distributed learning is a good approximation to the algorithm processing the whole data in one single machine. Our error bounds are sharp and stated in a general setting without any eigenfunction assumption. The analysis is achieved by a novel second order decomposition of operator differences in our integral operator approach.

We propose an active learning solution to enhance existing machine learning applications by actively interacting with the online prediction and offline training process. The technique identifies operating points where machine learning predictions based on power system measurements contradict with actual system conditions. By creating the training set around the identified operating points, it is possible to improve the capability of machine learning tools to predict future power system states. The technique also accelerates the offline training process by reducing the amount of simulations on a detailed power system model around operating points where correct predictions are made.

Harnessing the transformer's ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL, trained using the same losses, has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical. GTrXL offers an easy-to-train, simple-to-implement but substantially more expressive architectural alternative to the standard multi-layer LSTM ubiquitously used for RL agents in partially observable environments.",2019,57,164,18,false,Computer Science,3166516,Emilio Parisotto,2107148568,H.

Therefore, for many applications forecasts are only considered valuable if an uncertainty estimate can be assigned to them. Currently, the best method to provide a confidence estimate for individual forecasts is to produce an ensemble of numerical weather simulations, which is computationally very expensive. Here, we assess whether machine learning techniques can provide an alternative approach to predict the uncertainty of a weather forecast given the large‐scale atmospheric state at initialization. We propose a method based on deep learning with artificial convolutional neural networks that is trained on past weather forecasts. Given a new weather situation, it assigns a scalar value of confidence to medium‐range forecasts initialized from the said atmospheric state, indicating whether the predictability is higher or lower than usual for the time of the year. While our method has a lower skill than ensemble weather forecast models in predicting forecast uncertainty, it is computationally very efficient and outperforms a range of alternative methods that do not involve performing numerical forecasts. This shows that it is possible to use machine learning in order to estimate future forecast uncertainty from past forecasts. The main constraint in the performance of our method seems to be the number of past forecasts available for training the machine learning algorithm.",2018,26,99,1,true,Computer Science,89677034,S.

In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit’s attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit’s outcome. The challenge is that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects.

There is a need for risk stratification tools to inform personalized functional-disability preventive strategies for individuals in at-risk and early phases of these illnesses. Objective To determine whether predictors associated with social and role functioning can be identified in patients in clinical high-risk (CHR) states for psychosis or with recent-onset depression (ROD) using clinical, imaging-based, and combined machine learning; assess the geographic, transdiagnostic, and prognostic generalizability of machine learning and compare it with human prognostication; and explore sequential prognosis encompassing clinical and combined machine learning. Design, Setting, and Participants This multisite naturalistic study followed up patients in CHR states, with ROD, and with recent-onset psychosis, and healthy control participants for 18 months in 7 academic early-recognition services in 5 European countries. Participants were recruited between February 2014 and May 2016, and data were analyzed from April 2017 to January 2018. ain Outcomes and Measures Performance and generalizability of prognostic models. Results A total of 116 individuals in CHR states (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [5.1] years; 58 [50.0%] female) and 120 patients with ROD (mean [SD] age, 26.1 [6.1] years; 65 [54.2%] female) were followed up for a mean (SD) of 329 (142) days. Machine learning predicted the 1-year social-functioning outcomes with a balanced accuracy of 76.9% of patients in CHR states and 66.2% of patients with ROD using clinical baseline data. Balanced accuracy in models using structural neuroimaging was 76.2% in patients in CHR states and 65.0% in patients with ROD, and in combined models, it was 82.7% for CHR states and 70.3% for ROD. Lower functioning before study entry was a transdiagnostic predictor. Medial prefrontal and temporo-parieto-occipital gray matter volume (GMV) reductions and cerebellar and dorsolateral prefrontal GMV increments had predictive value in the CHR group; reduced mediotemporal and increased prefrontal-perisylvian GMV had predictive value in patients with ROD. Poor prognoses were associated with increased risk of psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders at follow-up in patients in the CHR state but not ones with ROD. Machine learning outperformed expert prognostication. Adding neuroimaging machine learning to clinical machine learning provided a 1.9-fold increase of prognostic certainty in uncertain cases of patients in CHR states, and a 10.5-fold increase of prognostic certainty for patients with ROD. Conclusions and Relevance Precision medicine tools could augment effective therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention of social functioning impairments in patients with CHR states or with ROD.",2018,130,122,3,true,Medicine,3214043,N.

Through feature learning—instead of feature engineering—deep neural networks promise to outperform both traditional physics-based and knowledge-based machine learning models for predicting molecular properties pertinent to drug discovery. To this end, we present the PotentialNet family of graph convolutions. These models are specifically designed for and achieve state-of-the-art performance for protein–ligand binding affinity.

Instead, users write labeling functions that express arbitrary heuristics, which can have unknown accuracies and correlations. Snorkel denoises their outputs without access to ground truth by incorporating the first end-to-end implementation of our recently proposed machine learning paradigm, data programming. We present a flexible interface layer for writing labeling functions based on our experience over the past year collaborating with companies, agencies, and research labs. In a user study, subject matter experts build models 2.8× faster and increase predictive performance an average 45.5% versus seven hours of hand labeling. We study the modeling tradeoffs in this new setting and propose an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions that gives up to 1.8× speedup per pipeline execution. In two collaborations, with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and on four open-source text and image data sets representative of other deployments, Snorkel provides 132% average improvements to predictive performance over prior heuristic approaches and comes within an average 3.60% of the predictive performance of large hand-curated training sets.",2017,68,715,120,true,Computer Science,143711421,Alexander J.

However, it is still challenging to learn useful high-level features when the data contains a significant amount of irrelevant patterns. Although feature selection can be used for such complex data, it may fail when we have to build a learning system from scratch (i.e., starting from the lack of useful raw features). To address this problem, we propose a point-wise gated Boltzmann machine, a unified generative model that combines feature learning and feature selection. Our model performs not only feature selection on learned high-level features (i.e., hidden units), but also dynamic feature selection on raw features (i.e., visible units) through a gating mechanism. For each example, the model can adaptively focus on a variable subset of visible nodes corresponding to the task-relevant patterns, while ignoring the visible units corresponding to the task-irrelevant patterns.

It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system.

Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed.

The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model.

Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy — our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%.

Modern experiments have exhaustively probed the basic notions of quantum theory. Arguably, further breakthroughs require the tackling of complex quantum phenomena and consequently require complex experiments and involved techniques. The designing of such complex experiments is difficult and often clashes with human intuition. We present an autonomous learning model which learns to design such complex experiments, without relying on previous knowledge or often flawed intuition. Our system not only learns how to design desired experiments more efficiently than the best previous approaches, but in the process also discovers nontrivial experimental techniques. Our work demonstrates that learning machines can offer dramatic advances in how experiments are generated. How useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory? Here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research. A major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. We investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments—a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning.

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues.

With decision tree as the baseline algorithm, two popular ensemble learning methods, bagging and boosting, were evaluated across different experiment conditions: using acoustic features only, using text-based features only; using both acoustic and text-based features. F0 related acoustic features are derived from underlying pitch targets. Models of four ToBI pitch accent types (High, Down-stepped high, Low, and Unaccented) are built at the syllable level. Results showed that in all experiments improved performance was achieved by ensemble learning.

We collected various candidate features from the examination of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and visual field (VF). We also developed synthesized features from original features. We then selected the best features proper for classification (diagnosis) through feature evaluation. We used 100 cases of data as a test dataset and 399 cases of data as a training and validation dataset. To develop the glaucoma prediction model, we considered four machine learning algorithms: C5.0, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). We repeatedly composed a learning model using the training dataset and evaluated it by using the validation dataset. Finally, we got the best learning model that produces the highest validation accuracy. We analyzed quality of the models using several measures. The random forest model shows best performance and C5.0, SVM, and KNN models show similar accuracy. In the random forest model, the classification accuracy is 0.98, sensitivity is 0.983, specificity is 0.975, and AUC is 0.979. The developed prediction models show high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in classifying among glaucoma and healthy eyes. It will be used for predicting glaucoma against unknown examination records. Clinicians may reference the prediction results and be able to make better decisions. We may combine multiple learning models to increase prediction accuracy. The C5.0 model includes decision rules for prediction. It can be used to explain the reasons for specific predictions.",2017,31,146,2,true,Computer Science,2109709900,S. Kim,88182610,K.

To address this challenge, we first show iteratively generated adversarial images easily transfer between networks trained with the same strategy. Inspired by this observation, we propose cascade adversarial training, which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training. We train a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks in addition to one-step adversarial images from the network being trained. We also propose to utilize embedding space for both classification and low-level (pixel-level) similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel level perturbation. During training, we inject adversarial images without replacing their corresponding clean images and penalize the distance between the two embeddings (clean and adversarial). Experimental results show that cascade adversarial training together with our proposed low-level similarity learning efficiently enhances the robustness against iterative attacks, but at the expense of decreased robustness against one-step attacks. We show that combining those two techniques can also improve robustness under the worst case black box attack scenario.",2017,19,90,3,false,Computer Science,40191008,Taesik Na,2813905,J.

Efficient greedy algorithms for learning and approximate inference have allowed these models to be applied successfully in many application domains.

Due to the presence of the partition function, model selection, complexity control, and exact maximum likelihood learning in RBM's are intractable. We show that Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) can be used to efficiently estimate the partition function of an RBM, and we present a novel AIS scheme for comparing RBM's with different architectures. We further show how an AIS estimator, along with approximate inference, can be used to estimate a lower bound on the log-probability that a DBN model with multiple hidden layers assigns to the test data.

With the burgeoning interest in machine learning comes the significant risk of misaligned expectations as to what it can and cannot accomplish. This paper evaluates the role of machine learning and the problems it solves within the context of current clinical challenges in radiation oncology. The role of learning algorithms within the workflow for external beam radiation therapy are surveyed, considering simulation imaging, multimodal fusion, image segmentation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and treatment delivery and adaptation. For each aspect, the clinical challenges faced, the learning algorithms proposed, and the successes and limitations of various approaches are analyzed. It is observed that machine learning has largely thrived on reproducibly mimicking conventional human-driven solutions with more efficiency and consistency. On the other hand, since algorithms are generally trained using expert opinion as ground truth, machine learning is of limited utility where problems or ground truths are not well-defined, or if suitable measures of correctness are not available. As a result, machines may excel at replicating, automating and standardizing human behaviour on manual chores, meanwhile the conceptual clinical challenges relating to definition, evaluation, and judgement remain in the realm of human intelligence and insight.",2019,130,72,1,false,Computer Science,123723354,Daniel Jarrett,144034191,E.

The reliability of docking depends, however, on the accuracy of the adopted scoring function (SF). Despite intense research over the years, improving the accuracy of SFs for structure‐based binding affinity prediction or virtual screening has proven to be a challenging task for any class of method. New SFs based on modern machine‐learning regression models, which do not impose a predetermined functional form and thus are able to exploit effectively much larger amounts of experimental data, have recently been introduced. These machine‐learning SFs have been shown to outperform a wide range of classical SFs at both binding affinity prediction and virtual screening. The emerging picture from these studies is that the classical approach of using linear regression with a small number of expert‐selected structural features can be strongly improved by a machine‐learning approach based on nonlinear regression allied with comprehensive data‐driven feature selection. Furthermore, the performance of classical SFs does not grow with larger training datasets and hence this performance gap is expected to widen as more training data becomes available in the future. Other topics covered in this review include predicting the reliability of a SF on a particular target class, generating synthetic data to improve predictive performance and modeling guidelines for SF development.

Recently, machine learning approaches were reported to have better predictive ability than the classic statistical analysis. We compared the performance of machine learning approaches with that of logistic regression analysis to predict AKI after liver transplantation. We reviewed 1211 patients and preoperative and intraoperative anesthesia and surgery-related variables were obtained. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI defined by acute kidney injury network criteria. The following machine learning techniques were used: decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, naïve Bayes, multilayer perceptron, and deep belief networks. These techniques were compared with logistic regression analysis regarding the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). AKI developed in 365 patients (30.1%). The performance in terms of AUROC was best in gradient boosting machine among all analyses to predict AKI of all stages (0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–0.93) or stage 2 or 3 AKI. The AUROC of logistic regression analysis was 0.61 (95% CI 0.56–0.66). Decision tree and random forest techniques showed moderate performance (AUROC 0.86 and 0.85, respectively). The AUROC of support the vector machine, naïve Bayes, neural network, and deep belief network was smaller than that of the other models. In our comparison of seven machine learning approaches with logistic regression analysis, the gradient boosting machine showed the best performance with the highest AUROC.

However, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to multiple security and privacy attacks. In particular, backdoor attacks against ML models have recently raised a lot of awareness. A successful backdoor attack can cause severe consequences, such as allowing an adversary to bypass critical authentication systems. Current backdooring techniques rely on adding static triggers (with fixed patterns and locations) on ML model inputs which are prone to detection by the current backdoor detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the first class of dynamic backdooring techniques against deep neural networks (DNN), namely Random Backdoor, Backdoor Generating Network (BaN), and conditional Backdoor Generating Network (c-BaN). Triggers generated by our techniques can have random patterns and locations, which reduce the efficacy of the current backdoor detection mechanisms. In particular, BaN and c-BaN based on a novel generative network are the first two schemes that algorithmically generate triggers. Moreover, c-BaN is the first conditional backdooring technique that given a target label, it can generate a target-specific trigger. Both BaN and c-BaN are essentially a general framework which renders the adversary the flexibility for further customizing backdoor attacks. We extensively evaluate our techniques on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10. Our techniques achieve almost perfect attack performance on back-doored data with a negligible utility loss.

With no unrealistic assumption, we first prove the following statements for the squared loss function of deep linear neural networks with any depth and any widths: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave, 2) every local minimum is a global minimum, 3) every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point, and 4) there exist ""bad"" saddle points (where the Hessian has no negative eigenvalue) for the deeper networks (with more than three layers), whereas there is no bad saddle point for the shallow networks (with three layers). Moreover, for deep nonlinear neural networks, we prove the same four statements via a reduction to a deep linear model under the independence assumption adopted from recent work. As a result, we present an instance, for which we can answer the following question: how difficult is it to directly train a deep model in theory? It is more difficult than the classical machine learning models (because of the non-convexity), but not too difficult (because of the nonexistence of poor local minima). Furthermore, the mathematically proven existence of bad saddle points for deeper models would suggest a possible open problem.

With the increasing number of important applications of machine learning systems, the reliability of such systems is also becoming increasingly important. A necessary step for ensuring reliability of such systems is to understand the features and characteristics of bugs occurred in the systems. A number of studies have investigated bugs and fixes in various software systems, but none focuses on machine learning systems. Machine learning systems are unique due to their algorithm-intensive nature and applications to potentially large-scale data, and thus deserve a special consideration.

SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with a high mortality rate among women. With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival will increase from 56% to more than 86%. Therefore, an accurate and reliable system is necessary for the early diagnosis of this cancer. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different machine learning techniques. Machine learning models can help physicians to reduce the number of false decisions. They try to exploit patterns and relationships among a large number of cases and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based classification method with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Breast cancer survival.


METHODS
We use a dataset with eight attributes that include the records of 900 patients in which 876 patients (97.3%) and 24 (2.7%) patients were females and males respectively. Naive Bayes (NB), Trees Random Forest (TRF), 1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN), AdaBoost (AD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), RBF Network (RBFN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques with 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival. The performance of machine learning techniques were evaluated with accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve.


RESULTS
Out of 900 patients, 803 patients and 97 patients were alive and dead, respectively. In this study, Trees Random Forest (TRF) technique showed better results in comparison to other techniques (NB, 1NN, AD, SVM and RBFN, MLP). The accuracy, sensitivity and the area under ROC curve of TRF are 96%, 96%, 93%, respectively. However, 1NN machine learning technique provided poor performance (accuracy 91%, sensitivity 91% and area under ROC curve 78%).


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that Trees Random Forest model (TRF) which is a rule-based classification model was the best model with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, this model is recommended as a useful tool for breast cancer survival prediction as well as medical decision making.",2016,41,118,1,false,Medicine,34400978,M.

This latter model, being trained, encapsulates the information about the model error localized for different hydrological conditions in the past and is used to estimate the probability distribution of the model error for the new hydrological model runs. The M5 model tree is used as a machine learning model. The method is tested to estimate uncertainty of a conceptual rainfall runoff model of the Bagmati catchment in Nepal.

This paper explores the release of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers while preserving the privacy of training data. The SVM is a popular machine learning method that maps data to a high-dimensional feature space before learning a linear decision boundary. We present efficient mechanisms for finite-dimensional feature mappings and for (potentially infinite-dimensional) mappings with translation-invariant kernels. In the latter case, our mechanism borrows a technique from large-scale learning to learn in a finite-dimensional feature space whose inner-product uniformly approximates the desired feature space inner-product (the desired kernel) with high probability. Differential privacy is established using algorithmic stability, a property used in learning theory to bound generalization error. Utility—when the private classifier is pointwise close to the non-private classifier with high probability—is proven using smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. Finally we conclude with lower bounds on the differential privacy of any mechanism approximating the SVM.",2009,58,263,17,true,Mathematics,1868067,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein,1745169,P.

In this report we describe a new unique public Ames mutagenicity data set comprising about 6500 nonconfidential compounds (available as SMILES strings and SDF) together with their biological activity. Three commercial tools (DEREK, MultiCASE, and an off-the-shelf Bayesian machine learner in Pipeline Pilot) are compared with four noncommercial machine learning implementations (Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Processes) on the new benchmark data set.",2009,8,241,9,false,Computer Science,39960184,K.

We propose an actively secure four-party protocol (4PC), and a framework for PPML, showcasing its applications on four of the most widely-known machine learning algorithms -- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. 
Our 4PC protocol tolerating at most one malicious corruption is practically efficient as compared to the existing works. We use the protocol to build an efficient mixed-world framework (Trident) to switch between the Arithmetic, Boolean, and Garbled worlds. Our framework operates in the offline-online paradigm over rings and is instantiated in an outsourced setting for machine learning. Also, we propose conversions especially relevant to privacy-preserving machine learning. 
The highlights of our framework include using a minimal number of expensive circuits overall as compared to ABY3. This can be seen in our technique for truncation, which does not affect the online cost of multiplication and removes the need for any circuits in the offline phase. Our B2A conversion has an improvement of $\mathbf{7} \times$ in rounds and $\mathbf{18} \times$ in the communication complexity. In addition to these, all of the special conversions for machine learning, e.g. Secure Comparison, achieve constant round complexity. 
The practicality of our framework is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of the aforementioned algorithms when compared with ABY3. All the protocols are implemented over a 64-bit ring in both LAN and WAN settings. Our improvements go up to $\mathbf{187} \times$ for the training phase and $\mathbf{158} \times$ for the prediction phase when observed over LAN and WAN.",2019,57,92,10,true,Computer Science,65831050,Rahul Rachuri,153456203,Ajith Suresh,Mathematics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SVM is a new machine learning technology that has been successfully applied in solving problems in the field of bioinformatics. The SVM's performance is usually better than that of traditional machine learning approaches. The performance was further improved by combining PSSM profiles with the SVM analysis. The PSSMs were generated from PSI‐BLAST profiles, which contain important evolution information. The final prediction results were generated from the second SVM layer output. On the CB513 data set, the three‐state overall per‐residue accuracy, Q3, reached 75.2%, while segment overlap (SOV) accuracy increased to 80.0%. On the CB396 data set, the Q3 of our method reached 74.0% and the SOV reached 78.1%.

These debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in our social experience, making for sociological and psychological complexity. This complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal property of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes. Racial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality. For people labeled ""Black"" it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social differentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved through both social and spatial segregation. In the United States, racial classification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status categories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying the Negro/black category as stigmatized. Social stigma is reinforced through the unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that is reinforced by state, corporate, and civic institutions and practices. This creates a dilemma for society and designers: be blind to racial group disparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer measuring systemic inequality, or be conscious of racial categories in a way that itself reifies race. We propose a third option. By preceding group fairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect patterns of segregation, machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause of social disparities, social segregation and stratification, without further anchoring status categories of disadvantage.",2018,56,69,2,true,Computer Science,2862008,Sebastian Benthall,40387211,Bruce D.

A crossover between quantum information and machine learning represents a new interdisciplinary area stimulating progress in both fields. Traditionally, a quantum state is characterized by quantum-state tomography, which is a resource-consuming process when scaled up. Here we experimentally demonstrate a machine-learning approach to construct a quantum-state classifier for identifying the separability of quantum states. We show that it is possible to experimentally train an artificial neural network to efficiently learn and classify quantum states, without the need of obtaining the full information of the states. We also show how adding a hidden layer of neurons to the neural network can significantly boost the performance of the state classifier. These results shed new light on how classification of quantum states can be achieved with limited resources, and represent a step towards machine-learning-based applications in quantum information processing.",2017,47,93,0,true,Medicine,2111014047,Jun Gao,6891618,Lu-Feng Qiao,Physics,66183707,Zhi-Qiang Jiao,2109387083,Yue-Chi Ma,50989843,Cheng-Qiu Hu,51012274,Ruo-Jing Ren,8026905,Ai-Lin Yang,2109238434,Hao Tang,Computer Science,145666876,M.
