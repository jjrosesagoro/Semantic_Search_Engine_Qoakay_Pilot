This problem has received considerable attention in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning, and many distinct methods have been proposed in literature. We make a comparative study of six well-known pruning methods with the aim of understanding their theoretical foundations, their computational complexity, and the strengths and weaknesses of their formulation. Comments on the characteristics of each method are empirically supported. In particular, a wide experimentation performed on several data sets leads us to opposite conclusions on the predictive accuracy of simplified trees from some drawn in the literature. We attribute this divergence to differences in experimental designs. Finally, we prove and make use of a property of the reduced error pruning method to obtain an objective evaluation of the tendency to overprune/underprune observed in each method.",1997,27,554,35,False,Computer Science,,,1700821,F.

In order for future networks to overcome the current limitations and address the issues of current cellular systems, it is clear that more intelligence needs to be deployed so that a fully autonomous and flexible network can be enabled. This paper focuses on the learning perspective of self-organizing networks (SON) solutions and provides, not only an overview of the most common ML techniques encountered in cellular networks but also manages to classify each paper in terms of its learning solution, while also giving some examples. The authors also classify each paper in terms of its self-organizing use-case and discuss how each proposed solution performed. In addition, a comparison between the most commonly found ML algorithms in terms of certain SON metrics is performed and general guidelines on when to choose each ML algorithm for each SON function are proposed. Lastly, this paper also provides future research directions and new paradigms that the use of more robust and intelligent algorithms, together with data gathered by operators, can bring to the cellular networks domain and fully enable the concept of SON in the near future.",2017,273,301,16,True,Computer Science,,,30927268,P.

However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby influencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases.",2018,42,109,8,True,Computer Science,,,1722184,D.

To overcome this challenge, federated learning can be a promising solution that enables on-device machine learning without the need to migrate the private end-user data to a central cloud. In federated learning, only learning model updates are transferred between end-devices and the aggregation server. Although federated learning can offer better privacy preservation than centralized machine learning, it has still privacy concerns. In this paper, first, we present the recent advances of federated learning towards enabling federated learning-powered IoT applications.

 Many Knowledge Bases (KBs) are now readily available and encompass colossal quantities of information thanks to either a long-term funding effort (e.g. WordNet, OpenCyc) or a collaborative process (e.g. Freebase, DBpedia). However, each of them is based on a different rigorous symbolic framework which makes it hard to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like nat- ural language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding, ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily used in recent machine learning meth- ods for prediction and information retrieval. We illustrate our method on WordNet and Freebase and also present a way to adapt it to knowledge extraction from raw text.

However, it is well known that in general, traditional training methods for ANNs such as back-propagation (BP) approach are normally slow and it could be trapped into local optima. In this paper, a fast electricity market price forecast method is proposed based on a recently emerged learning method for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, the extreme learning machine (ELM), to overcome these drawbacks. The new approach also has improved price intervals forecast accuracy by incorporating bootstrapping method for uncertainty estimations. Case studies based on chaos time series and Australian National Electricity Market price series show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity from the highly volatile price data series with much less computation time compared with other methods.

In Australia, the classification of native forest species using remote sensing data remains a particular challenge since there are many eucalyptus species that belong to the same genus and, thus, exhibit similar biophysical characteristics. This study assessed the potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing data and state-of-the-art machine-learning classification algorithms to classify Australian forest species at the leaf, canopy and community levels in Beecroft Peninsula, NSW, Australia. Spectral reflectance was acquired from an ASD spectrometer and airborne Hymap imagery for seven native forest species over an Australian eucalyptus forest. Three machine-learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF) were applied to classify the species. A comparative study was carried out between machine-learning classification algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The classification results show that all machine-leaning classification algorithms significantly improve the results produced by LDA. At the leaf level, RF achieved the best classification accuracy (94.7%), and SVM outperformed the other algorithms at both the canopy (84.5%) and community levels (75.5%).

Approaches to the reaction prediction problems can be organized around three poles corresponding to: (1) physical laws; (2) rule-based expert systems; and (3) inductive machine learning. Previous approaches at these poles, respectively, are not high throughput, are not generalizable or scalable, and lack sufficient data and structure to be implemented. We propose a new approach to reaction prediction utilizing elements from each pole. Using a physically inspired conceptualization, we describe single mechanistic reactions as interactions between coarse approximations of molecular orbitals (MOs) and use topological and physicochemical attributes as descriptors. Using an existing rule-based system (Reaction Explorer), we derive a restricted chemistry data set consisting of 1630 full multistep reactions with 2358 distinct starting materials and intermediates, associated with 2989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million unproductive mechanistic steps. And from machine learning, we pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a statistical ranking, information retrieval problem: given a set of reactants and a description of conditions, learn a ranking model over potential filled-to-unfilled MO interactions such that the top-ranked mechanistic steps yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we first train atom level reactivity filters to prune 94.00% of nonproductive reactions with a 0.01% error rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting MOs to learn a relative productivity function over mechanistic steps in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanism at the top 89.05% of the time, rising to 99.86% of the time when the top four are considered. Furthermore, the system is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert does not handle.

The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges. 2. A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates. 3. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species' potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration.",2006,46,259,19,False,Biology,,,34814486,J.

And yet, automated techniques for learning to filter e-mail have yet to significantly affect the e-mail market.

In a third-order Boltzmann machine, triples of units interact through symmetric conjunctive interactions. The Boltzmann learning algorithm is generalized t o higher-order interactions. The rate of learning for internal representations in a higher-order Boltzmann machine should be much faster t han for a second-order Boltzmann machine based on pairwise interactions. I N T R O D U C T I O N Thousands of hours of practice are required by humans t o become experts in domains such as chess, mathematics and physics1. Learning in these domains requires the mastery of a large number of highly interrelated ideas, and a deep understanding requires generalization as well as memorization. There are two traditions in the literature on learning in neural network models. One class of models is based on the problem of content-addressable memory and emphasizes a fast, one-shot form of learning. The second class of models uses slow, incremental learning, which requires many repetitions of examples. I t is difficult in humans t o s tudy fast and slow learning in isolation. In some amnesics, however, the long-term retention of facts is severely impaired, but the slow acquisition of skills, including cognitive skills, is spared2. Thus, it is possible tha t separate memory mechanisms are used t o implement fast learning and slow learning. Long practice is required t o become a n expert, bu t expert performance is swift and difficult to analyze; with more practice there is faster performance1. Why is slow learning so slow? One possibility is t h a t the expert develops internal representations tha t allow fast parallel searches for solutions t o problems in the task domain, in contrast t o a novice who must apply knowledge piecemeal. An internal representation is a mental model of the task domain; t h a t is, internal degrees of freedom between the sensory inputs and motor outputs t h a t efficiently encode the variables relevant t o the solution of the problem. This approach can be made more precise by specifying neural network models and showing how they incorporate internal representations. L E A R N I N G IN NETWORK M O D E L S Network models of fast learning include linear correlation-matrix m o d e l ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ l ~ and the more recent nonlinear autoassociative m o d e ~ s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ' ~ . These models use the Hebb learning rule t o store information t h a t can be retrieved by the completion of partially specified input patterns. New patterns are stored by imposing the pattern on the network and altering the connection strengths between the pairs of units that are above threshold. The information that is stored therefore concerns the correlations, .or second-order relationships between the components of the pattern. The internal model is built from correlations. Network models of slow learning include the perceptronll and adaline12. These networks can classify input patterns given only examples of inputs and desired outputs. The connection strengths are changed incrementally during the training and the network gradually converges to a set of weights tha t solves the problem if such as set of weights exists. Unfortunately, there are many difficult problems that cannot be solved with these networks, such as the prediction of parity'3. The perceptron and adaline are limited because they have only one layer of modifiable connection strengths and can only implement linear discriminant functions. Higher-order problems like parity cannot be solved by storing the desired patterns using the class of contentaddressable algorithms based on the Hebb learning rule. These models are limited because the metric of similarity is based on Hamming distance and only correlations can be used t o access patterns. The first network model to demonstrably learn t o solve higher-order problems was the Boltzmann machine, which overcame the limitations of previous network models by introducing hidden units14*15116. Hidden units are added t o the network t o mediate between the input and output units; they provide the extra internal degrees of freedom needed t o form internal representations. The Boltzmann learning algorithm incrementally modifies internal connections in the network to build higher-order pattern detectors. The hidden units can be recruited t o form internal representations for any problem; however, the learning may require an extremely large number of training examples and can be excessively slow. One way t o speed up the learning is to use hidden units that have higher-order interactions with other units. THIRD-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Consider a Boltzmann machine with a cubic global energy function: where si is the state of the i t h binary unit and w;p is a weight between triples of units. This type of interaction generalizes the pairwise interactions in Hopfield networkslo and Boltzmann machines, which contribute a quadratic term t o the energy. Fig. 1 shows an interpretation of the cubic term as conjunctive synapses. Each unit in the network updates its binary state asynchronously with probability where T is a parameter the i t h unit is given by analagous t o the temperature and the total input to If wijk is symmetric on all pairs of indices then the energy of the network is nonincreasing. It can be shown that in equilibrium the probabilities of global states P, follow a Boltzmann distribution Fig. 1. Third-order interactions between three units. In the diagram the lines between units represent reciprocal interactions that are activated only when the third unit is in the on state. The third unit acts presynaptically to conjunctively control the painvise interactions. There are two forms of the Boltzmann learning algorithm, one for networks with inputs and outputs treated identically, and a second for networks where the input units are always clamped15. The former learning algorithm will be generalized for third-order interactions. The learning metric on weight space remains the same: where P , is the probability of a global state with both the inputs and outputs clamped, and Pd, is the probability of a global state when the network is allowed to run freely. I t can be shown that the gradient of G is given by where p i jk is the ensemble average probability of three units all being in the on state when the input and output units are clamped, and pi;k is the corresponding probability when the network is running freely. T o minimize G , it is sufficient to measure the time averaged triple co-occurence probabilities when the network is in equilibrium under the two conditions and t o change each weight according to where c scales the size of each weight change. HIGHER-ORDER BOLTZMANN MACHINES Define the energy of a k -th order Boltzmann machine as where w 7172 . . . 7t is a k -dimensional weight indices. The G matrix can be minimized by matrix symmetric on all pairs of gradient descent: where P ~ , ~ . . . is the probability of the k-tuple co-occurence of the I (s 71 ,S 72 , . . s 7r ) when the inputs and outputs are clamped, and p 7172. . . 7L is the corresponding probability when the network is freely running. In general, the energy for a Boltzmann machine is the sum over all orders of interaction and the learning algorithm is a linear combination of terms from each order.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have been of special interest, since they can be applied in several steps of the drug discovery methodology, such as prediction of target structure, prediction of biological activity of new ligands through model construction, discovery or optimization of hits, and construction of models that predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological (ADMET) profile of compounds. Areas covered: This article presents an overview on some applications of ML techniques in drug design. These techniques can be employed in ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) studies, such as similarity searches, construction of classification and/or prediction models of biological activity, prediction of secondary structures and binding sites docking and virtual screening. Expert opinion: Successful cases have been reported in the literature, demonstrating the efficiency of ML techniques combined with traditional approaches to study medicinal chemistry problems. Some ML techniques used in drug design are: support vector machine, random forest, decision trees and artificial neural networks. Currently, an important application of ML techniques is related to the calculation of scoring functions used in docking and virtual screening assays from a consensus, combining traditional and ML techniques in order to improve the prediction of binding sites and docking solutions.",2016,184,160,5,False,Computer Science,Medicine,,46480421,Angélica Nakagawa Lima,2335673.0,E.

Our comparison addresses a central question in the deployment of technology-assisted review: Should training documents be selected at random, or should they be selected using one or more non-random methods, such as keyword search or active learning? On eight review tasks -- four derived from the TREC 2009 Legal Track and four derived from actual legal matters -- recall was measured as a function of human review effort. The results show that entirely non-random training methods, in which the initial training documents are selected using a simple keyword search, and subsequent training documents are selected by active learning, require substantially and significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) to achieve any given level of recall, than passive learning, in which the machine-learning algorithm plays no role in the selection of training documents. Among passive-learning methods, significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) is required when keywords are used instead of random sampling to select the initial training documents. Among active-learning methods, continuous active learning with relevance feedback yields generally superior results to simple active learning with uncertainty sampling, while avoiding the vexing issue of ""stabilization"" -- determining when training is adequate, and therefore may stop.",2014,32,142,31,True,Computer Science,,,3114123,G.

In harsh indoor environments, it is hard to localize an agent with high accuracy due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) radio blockage or insufficient information from anchors. Therefore, NLOS identification and mitigation are highlighted as an effective way to improve the localization accuracy. In this paper, we develop a robust and efficient algorithm to enhance the accuracy for (ultrawide bandwidth) time-of-arrival localization through identifying and mitigating NLOS signals with relevance vector machine (RVM) techniques. We also propose a new localization algorithm, called the two-step iterative (TSI) algorithm, which converges fast with a finite number of iterations. To enhance the localization accuracy as well as expand the coverage of a localizable area, we continue to exploit the benefits of RVM in both classification and regression for cooperative localization by extending the TSI algorithm to a centralized cooperation case. For self-localization setting, we then develop a distributed cooperative algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference to simplify message representations on factor graphs and reduce communication overheads between agents. In particular, we build a refined version of Gaussian variational message passing to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce the notion of a stochastic localization network to verify proposed cooperative localization algorithms.",2015,68,82,6,False,Computer Science,,,3106384,T. V.

We compared the accuracy of different techniques for detecting clinical deterioration on the wards in a large, multicenter database. Design:Observational cohort study. Setting:Five hospitals, from November 2008 until January 2013. Patients:Hospitalized ward patients Interventions:None Measurements And Main Results:Demographic variables, laboratory values, and vital signs were utilized in a discrete-time survival analysis framework to predict the combined outcome of cardiac arrest, intensive care unit transfer, or death. Two logistic regression models (one using linear predictor terms and a second utilizing restricted cubic splines) were compared to several different machine learning methods. The models were derived in the first 60% of the data by date and then validated in the next 40%. For model derivation, each event time window was matched to a non-event window. All models were compared to each other and to the Modified Early Warning score, a commonly cited early warning score, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A total of 269,999 patients were admitted, and 424 cardiac arrests, 13,188 intensive care unit transfers, and 2,840 deaths occurred in the study. In the validation dataset, the random forest model was the most accurate model (AUC, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.80-0.80]). The logistic regression model with spline predictors was more accurate than the model utilizing linear predictors (AUC, 0.77 vs 0.74; p < 0.01), and all models were more accurate than the MEWS (AUC, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.70-0.70]).

This type of deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learns much faster than the equivalent stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM), but since the learning procedure for DBM's is only based on an analogy with SBM's, there is no existing proof that it performs gradient descent in any function, and it has only been justified by simulations. By using the appropriate interpretation for the way in which a DBM represents the probability of an output vector given an input vector, it is shown that the DBM performs steepest descent in the same function as the original SBM, except at rare discontinuities. A very simple way of forcing the weights to become symmetrical is also described, and this makes the DBM more biologically plausible than back-propagation (Werbos 1974; Parker 1985; Rumelhart et al. 1986).",1989,5,181,13,False,Computer Science,Mathematics,,1695689,Geoffrey E.

Forecasting accuracy will depend on the complexity of the decision boundary. When that boundary is simple, most forecasting tools will have similar accuracy.

We propose an actively secure four-party protocol (4PC), and a framework for PPML, showcasing its applications on four of the most widely-known machine learning algorithms -- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. 
Our 4PC protocol tolerating at most one malicious corruption is practically efficient as compared to the existing works. We use the protocol to build an efficient mixed-world framework (Trident) to switch between the Arithmetic, Boolean, and Garbled worlds. Our framework operates in the offline-online paradigm over rings and is instantiated in an outsourced setting for machine learning. Also, we propose conversions especially relevant to privacy-preserving machine learning. 
The highlights of our framework include using a minimal number of expensive circuits overall as compared to ABY3. This can be seen in our technique for truncation, which does not affect the online cost of multiplication and removes the need for any circuits in the offline phase. Our B2A conversion has an improvement of $\mathbf{7} \times$ in rounds and $\mathbf{18} \times$ in the communication complexity. In addition to these, all of the special conversions for machine learning, e.g. Secure Comparison, achieve constant round complexity. 
The practicality of our framework is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of the aforementioned algorithms when compared with ABY3. All the protocols are implemented over a 64-bit ring in both LAN and WAN settings. Our improvements go up to $\mathbf{187} \times$ for the training phase and $\mathbf{158} \times$ for the prediction phase when observed over LAN and WAN.",2019,57,92,10,True,Computer Science,Mathematics,,65831050,Rahul Rachuri,153456203.0,Ajith Suresh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This huge success has led Internet companies to deploy machine learning as a service (MLaaS). Recently, the first membership inference attack has shown that extraction of information on the training set is possible in such MLaaS settings, which has severe security and privacy implications. 
However, the early demonstrations of the feasibility of such attacks have many assumptions on the adversary, such as using multiple so-called shadow models, knowledge of the target model structure, and having a dataset from the same distribution as the target model's training data. We relax all these key assumptions, thereby showing that such attacks are very broadly applicable at low cost and thereby pose a more severe risk than previously thought. We present the most comprehensive study so far on this emerging and developing threat using eight diverse datasets which show the viability of the proposed attacks across domains.

For use in the system we consider eight highly regarded machine learning algorithms, indicating the best performing one. Furthermore, the paper evaluates how much traffic needs to be observed per flow in order to capture the patterns of malicious traffic. The proposed system has been tested through the series of experiments using traffic traces originating from two well-known P2P botnets and diverse non-malicious applications. The results of experiments indicate that the system is able to accurately and timely detect botnet traffic using purely flow-based traffic analysis and supervised machine learning. Additionally, the results show that in order to achieve accurate detection traffic flows need to be monitored for only a limited time period and number of packets per flow.

Therefore, a good feature selection method based on the number of features investigated for sample classification is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, predictive accuracy, and to avoid incomprehensibility. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machines (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for the classification problem.

The primary goal of MLxtend is to make commonly used tools accessible to researchers in academia and data scientists in industries focussing on userfriendly and intuitive APIs and compatibility to existing machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn, when appropriate. While MLxtend implements a large variety of functions, highlights include sequential feature selection algorithms (Pudil, Novovičová, and Kittler 1994), implementations of stacked generalization (Wolpert 1992) for classification and regression, and algorithms for frequent pattern mining (Agrawal and Ramakrishnan 1994). The sequential feature selection algorithms cover forward, backward, forward floating, and backward floating selection and leverage scikit-learn’s cross-validation API (Pedregosa et al. 2011) to ensure satisfactory generalization performance upon constructing and selecting feature subsets. Besides, visualization functions are provided that allow users to inspect the estimated predictive performance, including performance intervals, for different feature subsets. The ensemble methods in MLxtend cover majority voting, stacking, and stacked generalization, all of which are compatible with scikit-learn estimators and other libraries as XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin 2016). In addition to feature selection, classification, and regression algorithms, MLxtend implements model evaluation techniques for comparing the performance of two different models via McNemar’s test and multiple models via Cochran’s Q test. An implementation of the 5x2 cross-validated paired t-test (Dietterich 1998) allows users to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms to each other. Furthermore, different flavors of the Bootstrap method (Efron and Tibshirani 1994), such as the .632 Bootstrap method (Efron 1983) are implemented to compute confidence intervals of performance estimates.

When training models for the potential energy surface of a single molecule, we find that the inclusion of atomic forces in the training data increases the accuracy of the predicted energies and forces 7-fold, compared to models trained on energy only. Surprisingly, for models trained on sets of organic molecules of varying size and composition in non-equilibrium conformations, inclusion of forces in the training does not improve the predicted energies of unseen molecules in new conformations. Predicted forces, however, improve about 7-fold. For the systems studied, we find that force labels and energy labels contribute equally per label to the convergence of the prediction errors. The optimal choice of what type of training data to include depends on several factors: the computational cost of acquiring the force and energy labels for training, the application domain, the property of interest and the complexity of the machine learning model.

In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift.

The concept of boosting emerged from the field of machine learning. The basic idea is to boost the accuracy of a weak classifying tool by combining various instances into a more accurate prediction. This general concept was later adapted to the field of statistical modelling. Nowadays, boosting algorithms are often applied to estimate and select predictor effects in statistical regression models.


OBJECTIVES
This review article attempts to highlight the evolution of boosting algorithms from machine learning to statistical modelling.


METHODS
We describe the AdaBoost algorithm for classification as well as the two most prominent statistical boosting approaches, gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting for statistical modelling. We highlight the methodological background and present the most common software implementations.


RESULTS
Although gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting are typically treated separately in the literature, they share the same methodological roots and follow the same fundamental concepts. Compared to the initial machine learning algorithms, which must be seen as black-box prediction schemes, they result in statistical models with a straight-forward interpretation.

Our model extends existing forest-based techniques as it unifies classification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning under the same decision forest framework. This means that the core implementation needs be written and optimized only once, and can then be applied to many diverse tasks. The proposed model may be used both in a generative or discriminative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labelled or unlabelled data. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) proposing a single, probabilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; 2) demonstrating margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; 3) introducing density forests for learning accurate probability density functions; 4) proposing efficient algorithms for sampling from the forest generative model; 5) introducing manifold forests for non-linear embedding and dimensionality reduction; 6) proposing new and efficient forest-based algorithms for transductive and active learning. We discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general model. This paper is directed at both students who wish to learn the basics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in our new contributions.

This task arises in the construction of search engines and Web knowledge bases. This paper argues that the creation of efficient web spiders is best framed and solved by reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that concerns itself with optimal sequential decision making. One strength of reinforcement learning is that it provides a formalism for measuring the utility of actions that give benefit only in the future. We present an algorithm for learning a value function that maps hyperlinks to future discounted reward using a naive Bayes text classifier. Experiments on two real-world spidering tasks show a threefold improvement in spidering efficiency over traditional breadth-first search, and up to a two-fold improvement over reinforcement learning with immediate reward only.",1999,19,298,16,False,Computer Science,,,35211659,Jason D.

In this task, the machine is asked to identify the unrelated or odd element from a set of otherwise related elements. We apply this technique to self-supervised video representation learning where we sample subsequences from videos and ask the network to learn to predict the odd video subsequence. The odd video subsequence is sampled such that it has wrong temporal order of frames while the even ones have the correct temporal order. Therefore, to generate a odd-one-out question no manual annotation is required. Our learning machine is implemented as multi-stream convolutional neural network, which is learned end-to-end. Using odd-one-out networks, we learn temporal representations for videos that generalizes to other related tasks such as action recognition. On action classification, our method obtains 60.3% on the UCF101 dataset using only UCF101 data for training which is approximately 10% better than current state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods.

Wrong model management decisions can lead to poor performance of a ML system and result in high maintenance cost. As both research on infrastructure as well as on algorithms is quickly evolving, there is a lack of understanding of challenges and best practices for ML model management. Therefore, this field is receiving increased attention in recent years, both from the data management as well as from the ML community.

For anomaly detection, also a semi-supervised variant, the one-class SVM, exists. Here, only normal data is required for training before anomalies can be detected. In theory, the one-class SVM could also be used in an unsupervised anomaly detection setup, where no prior training is conducted. Unfortunately, it turns out that a one-class SVM is sensitive to outliers in the data. In this work, we apply two modifications in order to make one-class SVMs more suitable for unsupervised anomaly detection: Robust one-class SVMs and eta one-class SVMs. The key idea of both modifications is, that outliers should contribute less to the decision boundary as normal instances. Experiments performed on datasets from UCI machine learning repository show that our modifications are very promising: Comparing with other standard unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, the enhanced one-class SVMs are superior on two out of four datasets. In particular, the proposed eta one-class SVM has shown the most promising results.",2013,76,293,34,False,Computer Science,,,11137394,Mennatallah Amer,2060959597.0,Markus Goldstein,2890092.0,S.

Change-level defect prediction, which is also referred as just-in-time defect prediction, could not only ensure software quality in the development process, but also make the developers check and fix the defects in time. Nowadays, deep learning is a hot topic in the machine learning literature. Whether deep learning can be used to improve the performance of just-in-time defect prediction is still uninvestigated. In this paper, to bridge this research gap, we propose an approach Deeper which leverages deep learning techniques to predict defect-prone changes. We first build a set of expressive features from a set of initial change features by leveraging a deep belief network algorithm. Next, a machine learning classifier is built on the selected features. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we use datasets from six large open source projects, i.e., Bugzilla, Columba, JDT, Platform, Mozilla, and PostgreSQL, containing a total of 137,417 changes. We compare our approach with the approach proposed by Kamei et al. The experimental results show that on average across the 6 projects, Deeper could discover 32.22% more bugs than Kamei et al's approach (51.04% versus 18.82% on average). In addition, Deeper can achieve F1-scores of 0.22-0.63, which are statistically significantly higher than those of Kamei et al.'s approach on 4 out of the 6 projects.",2015,42,254,20,False,Computer Science,Engineering,,3312173,Xinli Yang,143960553.0,D.

Nevertheless, most of this work suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training text for each. Real-life authorship attribution problems, however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus, following detailed discussion of previous work, three scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much demographic or psychological information as possible about the author. In the second variant, the needle-in-a-haystack problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the author. For each variant, it is shown how machine learning methods can be adapted to handle the special challenges of that variant. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2009,129,626,38,False,Computer Science,,,145200175,Moshe Koppel,2012715.0,Jonathan Schler,144628595.0,S.

End-to-end learning system is specifically designed so that all modules are differentiable. In effect, not only a central learning machine, but also all ""peripheral"" modules like representation learning and memory formation are covered by a holistic learning process. The power of end-to-end learning has been demonstrated on many tasks, like playing a whole array of Atari video games with a single architecture. While pushing for solutions to more challenging tasks, network architectures keep growing more and more complex. 
In this paper we ask the question whether and to what extent end-to-end learning is a future-proof technique in the sense of scaling to complex and diverse data processing architectures. We point out potential inefficiencies, and we argue in particular that end-to-end learning does not make optimal use of the modular design of present neural networks.

The reason for this lack of convergence is poorly understood. In this simulation study, we have examined a frequently used research procedure comprising three main ingredients: a single data sample, an accuracy indicator, and cross validation. Typically, these empirical studies compare a machine learning model with a regression model. In our study, we use simulation and compare a machine learning and a regression model. The results suggest that it is the research procedure itself that is unreliable. This lack of reliability may strongly contribute to the lack of convergence. Our findings thus cast some doubt on the conclusions of any study of competing software prediction models that used this research procedure as a basis of model comparison.

Essential features of SVM's remain, such as Mercer's condition and the fact that the output weights are a Lagrange multiplier weighted sum of the data points. The solution to recurrent least squares (LS-SVM's) is characterized by a set of nonlinear equations.

Nevertheless, a significant portion of search sessions are unsuccessful, i.e., do not provide information that the user was looking for. We present a machine learning framework that improves the quality of search results through automated personalization based on a user's search history. Our framework consists of three modules -- (a) Feature generation, (b) NDCG-based LambdaMART algorithm, and (c) Feature selection wrapper. We estimate our framework on large-scale data from a leading search engine using Amazon EC2 servers. We show that our framework offers a significant improvement in search quality compared to non-personalized results. We also show that the returns to personalization are monotonically, but concavely increasing with the length of user history. Next, we find that personalization based on short-term history or ""within-session"" behavior is less valuable than long-term or ""across-session"" personalization. We also derive the value of different feature sets -- user-specific features contribute over 50% of the improvement and click-specific over 28%.

Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to optimise the machine learning model and the logical reasoning model jointly. We demonstrate that by using abductive learning, machines can learn to recognise numbers and resolve unknown mathematical operations simultaneously from images of simple hand-written equations.
