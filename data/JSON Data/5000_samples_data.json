In practice, we search for a function f with a finite representation f = \u03a3i ci \u03c6i(\u00b7). In most treatments, the ci are the primary objects of study. We consider value regularization, constructing optimization problems in which the predicted values at the training points are the primary variables, and therefore the central objects of study. Although this is a simple change, it has profound consequences. From convex conjugacy and the theory of Fenchel duality, we derive separate optimality conditions for the regularization and loss portions of the learning problem; this technique yields clean and short derivations of standard algorithms. This framework is ideally suited to studying many other phenomena at the intersection of learning theory and optimization. We obtain a value-based variant of the representer theorem, which underscores the transductive nature of regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We unify and extend previous results on learning kernel functions, with very simple proofs. We analyze the use of unregularized bias terms in optimization problems, and low-rank approximations to kernel matrices, obtaining new results in these areas. In summary, the combination of value regularization and Fenchel duality are valuable tools for studying the optimization problems in machine learning.", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 88, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "11691394", "name": "R.

One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions.

In an ideal setting, we want to encrypt sensitive data to store them on a commercial cloud and run certain analyses without ever decrypting the data to preserve privacy. Homomorphic encryption technique is a promising candidate for secure data outsourcing, but it is a very challenging task to support real-world machine learning tasks. Existing frameworks can only handle simplified cases with low-degree polynomials such as linear means classifier and linear discriminative analysis. Objective The goal of this study is to provide a practical support to the mainstream learning models (eg, logistic regression). Methods We adapted a novel homomorphic encryption scheme optimized for real numbers computation. We devised (1) the least squares approximation of the logistic function for accuracy and efficiency (ie, reduce computation cost) and (2) new packing and parallelization techniques. Results Using real-world datasets, we evaluated the performance of our model and demonstrated its feasibility in speed and memory consumption. For example, it took approximately 116 minutes to obtain the training model from the homomorphically encrypted Edinburgh dataset. In addition, it gives fairly accurate predictions on the testing dataset.

Thus, the probable risk factors and association between these factors and motorcycle crash severity outcomes is not known. Traditional statistical models have intrinsic assumptions and pre-defined correlations that, if flouted, can generate inaccurate results. In this study, machine learning based algorithms were employed to predict and classify motorcycle crash severity. Machine learning based techniques are non-parametric models without the presumption of relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. The main aim of this research is to evaluate and compare different approaches to modeling motorcycle crash severity as well as investigating the effect of risk factors on the injury outcomes of motorcycle crashes. Motorcycle crash dataset between 2011 and 2015 was extracted from the National Road Traffic Crash Database at the Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) in Ghana. The dataset was classified into four injury severity categories: fatal, hospitalized, injured, and damage-only. Three machine learning based models were developed: J48 Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest (RF) and Instance-Based learning with parameter k (IBk) were employed to model the severity of injury in a motorcycle crash. These machine learning algorithms were validated using 10-fold cross-validation technique. The three machine learning based algorithms were compared with one another and the statistical model: multinomial logit model (MNLM). Also, the relative importance analysis of the attribute was conducted to determine the impact of these attributes on injury severity outcomes. The results of the study reveal that the predictions of machine learning algorithms are superior to the MNLM in accuracy and effectiveness, and the RF-based algorithms show the overall best agreement with the experimental data out of the three machine learning algorithms, for its global optimization and extrapolation ability.

Toward this future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of models, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The FL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from a server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server, while asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve the model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private data, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are with limited computational resources (i.e., requiring longer update time) or under poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL protocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL efficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions. Specifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource constraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models. We conducted an experimental evaluation using publicly-available large-scale image datasets to train deep neural networks on MEC environment simulations.

In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis.

Its accurate evaluation from first principles requires quantum chemistry methods that are often too demanding for routine use. The highly accurate calculations reported herein provide a much-needed benchmark of the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as well as training data for a machine-learning model that can predict the polarizability tensor with an error that is about 50% smaller than DFT. This framework provides an accurate, inexpensive, and transferable strategy for estimating the polarizabilities of molecules containing dozens of atoms, and therefore removes a considerable obstacle to accurate and reliable atomistic-based modeling of matter. The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 95, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6287077", "name": "D.

We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated.

It first presents an explicit computational model of language acquisition which can actually learn rules of English syntax given a sequence of grammatical, but otherwise unprepared, sentences.It shows that natural languages are designed to be easily learned and easily processed-an exciting breakthrough from the point of view of artificial intelligence and the design of expert systems because it shows how extensive knowledge might be acquired automatically, without outside intervention.

In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of \u201cfree\u201d self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge.

Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only. Results Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously.

In this paper, we show that prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers to perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data samples, such as the attack accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we first propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack method based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose benchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with knowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model accuracy and privacy risks. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that existing defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported. \nNext, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate that the distribution of the privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous. Finally, we perform an in-depth investigation for understanding why certain samples have high privacy risk scores, including correlations with model sensitivity, generalization error, and feature embeddings.

Their negative impact on source code maintainability and comprehensibility has been widely shown in the past and several techniques to automatically detect them have been devised. Most of these techniques are based on heuristics, namely they compute a set of code metrics and combine them by creating detection rules; while they have a reasonable accuracy, a recent trend is represented by the use of machine learning where code metrics are used as predictors of the smelliness of code artefacts. Despite the recent advances in the field, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge of whether machine learning can actually be more accurate than traditional heuristic-based approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a large-scale study to empirically compare the performance of heuristic-based and machine-learning-based techniques for metric-based code smell detection. We consider five code smell types and compare machine learning models with DECOR, a state-of-the-art heuristic-based approach.

In this paper, we propose a family of IR loss functions to measure the performance of nondeterministic learners. After discussing such measures, we derive an algorithm for learning optimal nondeterministic hypotheses. Given an entry from the input space, the algorithm requires the posterior probabilities to compute the subset of classes with the lowest expected loss. From a general point of view, nondeterministic classifiers provide an improvement in the proportion of predictions that include the true class compared to their deterministic counterparts; the price to be paid for this increase is usually a tiny proportion of predictions with more than one class. The paper includes an extensive experimental study using three deterministic learners to estimate posterior probabilities: a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Logistic Regression, and a Naive Bayes.

Similarly, most learning techniques used in practice are brittle to the presence of large amounts of biased or malicious data. Motivated by this, we consider two frameworks for studying estimation, learning, and optimization in the presence of significant fractions of arbitrary data. The first framework, list-decodable learning, asks whether it is possible to return a list of answers such that at least one is accurate. For example, given a dataset of n points for which an unknown subset of \u03b1n points are drawn from a distribution of interest, and no assumptions are made about the remaining (1 - \u03b1)n points, is it possible to return a list of poly(1/\u03b1) answers? The second framework, which we term the semi-verified model, asks whether a small dataset of trusted data (drawn from the distribution in question) can be used to extract accurate information from a much larger but untrusted dataset (of which only an \u03b1-fraction is drawn from the distribution). We show strong positive results in both settings, and provide an algorithm for robust learning in a very general stochastic optimization setting.

It also permits theintroduction of various tensor network operations without an explicitnotion of mathematical expressions, which may be beneficial for manyresearch communities that do not directly rely on multilinear algebra.Our focus is on the Tucker and tensor train TT decompositions andtheir extensions, and on demonstrating the ability of tensor networksto provide linearly or even super-linearly e.g., logarithmically scalablesolutions, as illustrated in detail in Part 2 of this monograph.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 279, "citationCount": 324, "influentialCitationCount": 21, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145683892", "name": "A.

Every week, new applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence are added to a growing corpus of work. Random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks are now having a genuine impact for applications as diverse as discovering extrasolar planets, transient objects, quasars, and gravitationally lensed systems, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. This review surveys contemporary, published literature on machine learning and artificial intelligence in astronomy and astrophysics. Applications span seven main categories of activity: classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. These categories form the basis of a hierarchy of maturity, as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence emerges, progresses, or becomes established.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 353, "citationCount": 45, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2040500", "name": "C.

We study this approach with new multi-class classification methods and examined many issues important for a practical recognition system.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost current discriminative methods for protein fold prediction use the one-against-others method, which has the well-known 'False Positives' problem. We investigated two new methods: the unique one-against-others and the all-against-all methods. Both improve prediction accuracy by 14-110% on a dataset containing 27 SCOP folds. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Neural Network (NN) learning methods as base classifiers. SVMs converges fast and leads to high accuracy. When scores of multiple parameter datasets are combined, majority voting reduces noise and increases recognition accuracy. We examined many issues involved with large number of classes, including dependencies of prediction accuracy on the number of folds and on the number of representatives in a fold. Overall, recognition systems achieve 56% fold prediction accuracy on a protein test dataset, where most of the proteins have below 25% sequence identity with the proteins used in training.", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 890, "influentialCitationCount": 136, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1737469", "name": "C.

Yet what makes a system \u201cintelligible\u201d is difficult to pin down. Intelligibility is a fundamentally human-centered concept that lacks a one-size-fits-all solution. Although many intelligibility techniques have been proposed in the machine learning literature, there are many more open questions about how best to provide stakeholders with the information they need to achieve their desired goals. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the intelligible machine learning landscape and give several examples of the diverse ways in which needs for intelligibility can arise. We provide an overview of the techniques for achieving intelligibility that have been proposed in the machine learning literature. We discuss the importance of taking a human-centered strategy when designing intelligibility techniques or when verifying that these techniques achieve their intended goals. We also argue that the notion of intelligibility should be expanded beyond machine learning models to other components of machine learning systems, such as datasets and performance metrics.

Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 94, "citationCount": 78, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2580557", "name": "Y.
