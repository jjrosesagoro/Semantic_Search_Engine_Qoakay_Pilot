G. Valiant (V84). In the distribution-free model, a learning algorithm receives positive and negative examples of an unknown target set (or concept) that is chosen from some known class of sets (or concept class). These examples are generated randomly according to a fixed but unknown probability distribution representing Nature, and the goal of the learning algorithm is to infer an hypothesis concept that closely approximates the target concept with respect to the unknown distribution. This thesis is concerned with proving theorems about learning in this formal mathematical model. \nWe are interested in the phenomenon of efficient learning in the distribution-free model, in the standard polynomial-time sense. Our results include general tools for determining the polynomial-time learnability of a concept class, an extensive study of efficient learning when errors are present in the examples, and lower bounds on the number of examples required for learning in our model. A centerpiece of the thesis is a series of results demonstrating the computational difficulty of learning a number of well-studied concept classes. These results are obtained by reducing some apparently hard number-theoretic problems from cryptography to the learning problems. The hard-to-learn concept classes include the sets represented by Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata and a simplified form of neural networks. We also give algorithms for learning powerful concept classes under the uniform distribution, and give equivalences between natural models of efficient learnability. \nThis thesis also includes detailed definitions and motivation for the distribution-free model, a chapter discussing past research in this model and related models, and a short list of important open problems.", "year": 1990, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 244, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2056642528", "name": "M.

Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund & Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone.

We try to emphasize relations of the theory of learning to the mainstream of mathematics. In particular, there are large roles for probability theory, for algorithms such as least squares, and for tools and ideas from linear algebra and linear analysis. An advantage of doing this is that communication is facilitated and the power of core mathematics is more easily brought to bear. We illustrate what we mean by learning theory by giving some instances. (a) The understanding of language acquisition by children or the emergence of languages in early human cultures. (b) In Manufacturing Engineering, the design of a new wave of machines is anticipated which uses sensors to sample properties of objects before, during, and after treatment. The information gathered from these samples is to be analyzed by the machine to decide how to better deal with new input objects (see [43]). (c) Pattern recognition of objects ranging from handwritten letters of the alphabet to pictures of animals, to the human voice. Understanding the laws of learning plays a large role in disciplines such as (Cognitive) Psychology, Animal Behavior, Economic Decision Making, all branches of Engineering, Computer Science, and especially the study of human thought processes (how the brain works). Mathematics has already played a big role towards the goal of giving a universal foundation of studies in these disciplines. We mention as examples the theory of Neural Networks going back to McCulloch and Pitts [25] and Minsky and Papert [27], the PAC learning of Valiant [40], Statistical Learning Theory as developed by Vapnik [42], and the use of reproducing kernels as in [17] among many other mathematical developments.

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence.", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount": 1174, "influentialCitationCount": 50, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1751762", "name": "Yoshua Bengio"}, {"authorId": "1688882", "name": "Yann LeCun"}]}, {"paperId": "2a1724427b9c473e73f6abff648e7416269d3a68", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a1724427b9c473e73f6abff648e7416269d3a68", "title": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning: The State of the Art", "abstract": null, "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 420, "citationCount": 1252, "influentialCitationCount": 69, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1703826", "name": "Liviu Panait"}, {"authorId": "1706276", "name": "S.

Specifically, we have shown that SBL retains a desirable property of the /spl lscr//sub 0/-norm diversity measure (i.e., the global minimum is achieved at the maximally sparse solution) while often possessing a more limited constellation of local minima.

We claim that the problem of dialog design can be formalized as an optimization problem with an objective function reflecting different dialog dimensions relevant for a given application. We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups.", "year": 2000, "referenceCount": 36, "citationCount": 588, "influentialCitationCount": 45, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "8992604", "name": "E.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods.

One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially. The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 3277, "influentialCitationCount": 715, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2066516991", "name": "J.

An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived through the camera.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 3787, "influentialCitationCount": 730, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145714153", "name": "A.

The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest.

The authors present the basic ideas of SVMs together with the latest developments and current research questions in a unified style. They identify three reasons for the success of SVMs: their ability to learn well with only a very small number of free parameters, their robustness against several types of model violations and outliers, and their computational efficiency compared to several other methods. Since their appearance in the early nineties, support vector machines and related kernel-based methods have been successfully applied in diverse fields of application such as bioinformatics, fraud detection, construction of insurance tariffs, direct marketing, and data and text mining. As a consequence, SVMs now play an important role in statistical machine learning and are used not only by statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists, but also by engineers and data analysts. The book provides a unique in-depth treatment of both fundamental and recent material on SVMs that so far has been scattered in the literature. The book can thus serve as both a basis for graduate courses and an introduction for statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists. It further provides a valuable reference for researchers working in the field. The book covers all important topics concerning support vector machines such as: loss functions and their role in the learning process; reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and their properties; a thorough statistical analysis that uses both traditional uniform bounds and more advanced localized techniques based on Rademacher averages and Talagrand's inequality; a detailed treatment of classification and regression; a detailed robustness analysis; and a description of some of the most recent implementation techniques.

However, recent studies have shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we tested.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 2336, "influentialCitationCount": 190, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1967156", "name": "Nicolas Papernot"}, {"authorId": "144061974", "name": "P.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works.
