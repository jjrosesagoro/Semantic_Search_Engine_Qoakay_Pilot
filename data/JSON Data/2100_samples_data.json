Our framework, COCOA+, allows for additive combination of local updates to the global parameters at each iteration, whereas previous schemes with convergence guarantees only allow conservative averaging. We give stronger (primal-dual) convergence rate guarantees for both COCOA as well as our new variants, and generalize the theory for both methods to cover non-smooth convex loss functions.

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization.

When machine learning is deployed in the real world, its performance can be significantly degraded because test data may follow a different distribution from training data. DRSL with f-divergences explicitly considers the worst-case distribution shift by minimizing the adversarially reweighted training loss. In this paper, we analyze this DRSL, focusing on the classification scenario. Since the DRSL is explicitly formulated for a distribution shift scenario, we naturally expect it to give a robust classifier that can aggressively handle shifted distributions. However, surprisingly, we prove that the DRSL just ends up giving a classifier that exactly fits the given training distribution, which is too pessimistic. This pessimism comes from two sources: the particular losses used in classification and the fact that the variety of distributions to which the DRSL tries to be robust is too wide. Motivated by our analysis, we propose simple DRSL that overcomes this pessimism and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount": 161, "influentialCitationCount": 22, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48594758", "name": "Weihua Hu"}, {"authorId": "47537639", "name": "Gang Niu"}, {"authorId": "73355331", "name": "Issei Sato"}, {"authorId": "67154907", "name": "Masashi Sugiyama"}]}, {"paperId": "7eb733c8ac1b3d1dd8b50e066ddae10769e3b46e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7eb733c8ac1b3d1dd8b50e066ddae10769e3b46e", "title": "CrypTen: Secure Multi-Party Computation Meets Machine Learning", "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations on data while keeping that data private.

This technical manuscript summarises, formalises and extends the link by systematically rephrasing quantum models as a kernel method. It shows that most near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. In particular, kernel-based training is guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training.

There are a growing number of research papers related to social media, a small number of which focus on personality prediction. To date, studies have typically focused on the Big Five traits of personality, but one area which is relatively unexplored is that of the anti-social traits of narcissism, Machiavellians and psychopathy, commonly referred to as the Dark Triad. This study explored the extent to which it is possible to determine anti-social personality traits based on Twitter use. This was performed by comparing the Dark Triad and Big Five personality traits of 2,927 Twitter users with their profile attributes and use of language. Analysis shows that there are some statistically significant relationships between these variables. Through the use of crowd sourced machine learning algorithms, we show that machine learning provides useful prediction rates, but is imperfect in predicting an individual's Dark Triad traits from Twitter activity. While predictive models may be unsuitable for predicting an individual's personality, they may still be of practical importance when models are applied to large groups of people, such as gaining the ability to see whether anti-social traits are increasing or decreasing over a population.

Yet, machine learning models, including DNNs, were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial samples-subtly (and often humanly indistinguishably) modified malicious inputs crafted to compromise the integrity of their outputs. Adversarial examples thus enable adversaries to manipulate system behaviors. Potential attacks include attempts to control the behavior of vehicles, have spam content identified as legitimate content, or have malware identified as legitimate software. Adversarial examples are known to transfer from one model to another, even if the second model has a different architecture or was trained on a different set. We introduce the first practical demonstration that this cross-model transfer phenomenon enables attackers to control a remotely hosted DNN with no access to the model, its parameters, or its training data. In our demonstration, we only assume that the adversary can observe outputs from the target DNN given inputs chosen by the adversary. We introduce the attack strategy of fitting a substitute model to the input-output pairs in this manner, then crafting adversarial examples based on this auxiliary model. We evaluate the approach on existing DNN datasets and real-world settings. In one experiment, we force a DNN supported by MetaMind (one of the online APIs for DNN classifiers) to mis-classify inputs at a rate of 84.24%.

For many of these applications, local embedded processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or latency concerns, or hmitations in the communication bandwidth.

For graph-based semi-supervised learning, a recent important development is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which nicely integrate local vertex features and graph topology in the convolutional layers. Although the GCN model compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, its mechanisms are not clear and it still requires considerable amount of labeled data for validation and model selection. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the GCN model and address its fundamental limits. First, we show that the graph convolution of the GCN model is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which is the key reason why GCNs work, but it also brings potential concerns of over-smoothing with many convolutional layers. Second, to overcome the limits of the GCN model with shallow architectures, we propose both co-training and self-training approaches to train GCNs. Our approaches significantly improve GCNs in learning with very few labels, and exempt them from requiring additional labels for validation.

Chameleon departs from the common assumption of additive or linear secret sharing models where three or more parties need to communicate in the online phase: the framework allows two parties with private inputs to communicate in the online phase under the assumption of a third node generating correlated randomness in an offline phase. Almost all of the heavy cryptographic operations are precomputed in an offline phase which substantially reduces the communication overhead. Chameleon is both scalable and significantly more efficient than the ABY framework (NDSS'15) it is based on. Our framework supports signed fixed-point numbers. In particular, Chameleon's vector dot product of signed fixed-point numbers improves the efficiency of mining and classification of encrypted data for algorithms based upon heavy matrix multiplications.

The task includes clustering and hash learning as special cases. Deep neural networks are promising to be used because they can model the non-linearity of data and scale to large datasets. However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, we need to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful representations that exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest. To this end, we propose a method called Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT). In IMSAT, we use data augmentation to impose the invari-ance on discrete representations.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that employs a bioinspired spike-based learning algorithm for the LSM. With the proposed online learning, the LSM extracts information from input patterns on the fly without needing intermediate data storage as required in offline learning methods such as ridge regression. The proposed learning rule is local such that each synaptic weight update is based only upon the firing activities of the corresponding presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons without incurring global communications across the neural network. Compared with the backpropagation-based learning, the locality of computation in the proposed approach lends itself to efficient parallel VLSI implementation. We use subsets of the TI46 speech corpus to benchmark the bioinspired digital LSM. To reduce the complexity of the spiking neural network model without performance degradation for speech recognition, we study the impacts of synaptic models on the fading memory of the reservoir and hence the network performance. Moreover, we examine the tradeoffs between synaptic weight resolution, reservoir size, and recognition performance and present techniques to further reduce the overhead of hardware implementation. Our simulation results show that in terms of isolated word recognition evaluated using the TI46 speech corpus, the proposed digital LSM rivals the state-of-the-art hidden Markov-model-based recognizer Sphinx-4 and outperforms all other reported recognizers including the ones that are based upon the LSM or neural networks.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 115, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2144289286", "name": "Yong Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2149247466", "name": "Peng Li"}, {"authorId": "3021143", "name": "Yingyezhe Jin"}, {"authorId": "1744412", "name": "Yoonsuck Choe"}]}, {"paperId": "c6bbfb4fcaecc779c899af4bb52083870f4b996a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6bbfb4fcaecc779c899af4bb52083870f4b996a", "title": "Future Internet: The Internet of Things Architecture, Possible Applications and Key Challenges", "abstract": "The Internet is continuously changing and evolving.

Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to information loss in representing hyperspectral pixels, which intrinsically have a sequence-based data structure. A recurrent neural network (RNN), an important branch of the deep learning family, is mainly designed to handle sequential data. Can sequence-based RNN be an effective method of hyperspectral image classification? In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model that can effectively analyze hyperspectral pixels as sequential data and then determine information categories via network reasoning. As far as we know, this is the first time that an RNN framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, our RNN makes use of a newly proposed activation function, parametric rectified tanh (PRetanh), for hyperspectral sequential data analysis instead of the popular tanh or rectified linear unit. The proposed activation function makes it possible to use fairly high learning rates without the risk of divergence during the training procedure. Moreover, a modified gated recurrent unit, which uses PRetanh for hidden representation, is adopted to construct the recurrent layer in our network to efficiently process hyperspectral data and reduce the total number of parameters. Experimental results on three airborne hyperspectral images suggest competitive performance in the proposed mode.

However, it has been reported that, in some cases existing semi-supervised learning approaches perform even worse than supervised ones which only use labeled data. For this reason, it is desirable to develop safe semi-supervised learning approaches that will not significantly reduce learning performance when unlabeled data are used. This paper focuses on improving the safeness of semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs). First, the S3VM-us approach is proposed. It employs a conservative strategy and uses only the unlabeled instances that are very likely to be helpful, while avoiding the use of highly risky ones. This approach improves safeness but its performance improvement using unlabeled data is often much smaller than S3VMs. In order to develop a safe and well-performing approach, we examine the fundamental assumption of S3VMs, i.e., low-density separation. Based on the observation that multiple good candidate low-density separators may be identified from training data, safe semi-supervised support vector machines (S4VMs) are here proposed. This approach uses multiple low-density separators to approximate the ground-truth decision boundary and maximizes the improvement in performance of inductive SVMs for any candidate separator. Under the assumption employed by S3VMs, it is here shown that S4VMs are provably safe and that the performance improvement using unlabeled data can be maximized. An out-of-sample extension of S4VMs is also presented. This extension allows S4VMs to make predictions on unseen instances. Our empirical study on a broad range of data shows that the overall performance of S4VMs is highly competitive with S3VMs, whereas in contrast to S3VMs which hurt performance significantly in many cases, S4VMs rarely perform worse than inductive SVMs.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 62, "citationCount": 298, "influentialCitationCount": 41, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2110463675", "name": "Yu-Feng Li"}, {"authorId": "145624000", "name": "Zhi-Hua Zhou"}]}, {"paperId": "055e2b142026cadd9ebb7b740e1641d6fafa962b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/055e2b142026cadd9ebb7b740e1641d6fafa962b", "title": "Machine Unlearning", "abstract": "Once users have shared their data online, it is generally difficult for them to revoke access and ask for the data to be deleted. Machine learning (ML) exacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have memorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing their information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult.We introduce SISA training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure. While our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. SISA training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set. In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead from unlearning.Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains, with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that SISA training improves time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63\u00d7, and 2.45\u00d7 for the SVHN dataset, over retraining from scratch. SISA training also provides a speed-up of 1.36\u00d7 in retraining for complex learning tasks such as ImageNet classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation in accuracy.

It can also benefit cloud service providers who can offer a new charging model based on the VMs' performance instead of their configured sizes. In this paper, we present techniques to model the performance of a VM-hosted application as a function of the resources allocated to the VM and the resource contention it experiences.

In practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We introduce \\emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers. Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.

However, the search for saddle points often involves hundreds or thousands of ab initio force calls, which are typically all done at full accuracy. This results in the vast majority of the computational effort being spent calculating the electronic structure of states not important to the researcher, and very little time performing the calculation of the saddle point state itself. In this work, we describe how machine learning (ML) can reduce the number of intermediate ab initio calculations needed to locate saddle points. Since machine-learning models can learn from, and thus mimic, atomistic simulations, the saddle-point search can be conducted rapidly in the machine-learning representation. The saddle-point prediction can then be verified by an ab initio calculation; if it is incorrect, this strategically has identified regions of the PES where the machine-learning representation has insufficient training data. When these training data are used to improve the machine-learning model, the estimates greatly improve. This approach can be systematized, and in two simple example problems we demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the number of ab initio force calls.

Custom operators are needed where the computation does not fit existing high-performance library calls, usually at a high engineering cost. This is frequently required when new operators are invented by researchers: such operators suffer a severe performance penalty, which limits the pace of innovation. Furthermore, even if there is an existing runtime call these frameworks can use, it often doesn't offer optimal performance for a user's particular network architecture and dataset, missing optimizations between operators as well as optimizations that can be done knowing the size and shape of data. Our contributions include (1) a language close to the mathematics of deep learning called Tensor Comprehensions offering both imperative and declarative styles, (2) a polyhedral Just-In-Time compiler to convert a mathematical description of a deep learning DAG into a CUDA kernel with delegated memory management and synchronization, also providing optimizations such as operator fusion and specialization for specific sizes, (3) a compilation cache populated by an autotuner.

This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper, our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition, we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of the most significant published approaches, within the families of the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference. This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier, therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant enhancement of the results.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 121, "citationCount": 1981, "influentialCitationCount": 142, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1924061", "name": "M.

Most learning algorithms that involve optimisation of the mutual information rely on the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm --- an enumerative algorithm with exponential complexity that is not suitable for modern machine learning applications. This paper provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning. We develop our approach by focusing on the problem of intrinsically-motivated learning, where the mutual information forms the definition of a well-known internal drive known as empowerment. Using a variational lower bound on the mutual information, combined with convolutional networks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic optimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information maximisation and empowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount": 324, "influentialCitationCount": 16, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "14594344", "name": "S.
