As these models get more and more complex, it also becomes harder for users to assess and trust their results, since their internal operations are mostly hidden in black boxes. The interpretation of machine learning models is currently a hot topic in the information visualization community, with results showing that insights from machine learning models can lead to better predictions and improve the trustworthiness of the results. Due to this, multiple (and extensive) survey articles have been published recently trying to summarize the high number of original research papers published on the topic. But there is not always a clear definition of what these surveys cover, what is the overlap between them, which types of machine learning models they deal with, or what exactly is the scenario that the readers will find in each of them. In this article, we present a meta-analysis (i.e. a \u201csurvey of surveys\u201d) of manually collected survey papers that refer to the visual interpretation of machine learning models, including the papers discussed in the selected surveys. The aim of our article is to serve both as a detailed summary and as a guide through this survey ecosystem by acquiring, cataloging, and presenting fundamental knowledge of the state of the art and research opportunities in the area. Our results confirm the increasing trend of interpreting machine learning with visualizations in the past years, and that visualization can assist in, for example, online training processes of deep learning models and enhancing trust into machine learning. However, the question of exactly how this assistance should take place is still considered as an open challenge of the visualization community.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 101, "citationCount": 60, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "52197250", "name": "Angelos Chatzimparmpas"}, {"authorId": "47758081", "name": "R.

When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzy-logical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts.

RF waveforms represent a particular challenge because of the extremely high data rates involved and the potentially large number of transmitters sharing a channel in a given location. These factors outline the need for rapid fingerprinting and identification methods that go beyond the traditional hand-engineered approaches.

Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that minimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently sequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative optimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring real-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric view of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We show a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for structured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of proximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings.

Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propagation algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectationmaximisation (EM) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the VB EM algorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential (CE) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated VB derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the VB EM algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models. It is shown how model selection tasks such as determining the dimensionality, cardinality, or number of variables are possible using VB approximations. Also explored are methods for combining sampling procedures with variational approximations, to estimate the tightness of VB bounds and to obtain more effective sampling algorithms. Chapter 6 applies VB learning to a long-standing problem of scoring discrete-variable directed acyclic graphs, and compares the performance to annealed importance sampling amongst other methods.

Introduction.-This note introduces some nonlinear difference-differential equations which can be interpreted as a learning theory or, alternatively, as a prediction theory whose goal is to discuss the prediction of individual events, in a fixed order, and at prescribed times. The theory provides a mathematical description of the following kind of experiment. An experimenter g, confronted by a machine MlZ, presents M with a list of \"letters\" or \"events\" to be learned. Suppose, for example, that g wishes to teach 9Mt the list of letters AB, or to predict the event B, given the event A. g does this by presenting A and then B to M several times. To find out if SE has learned the list as a result of these list presentations, the letter A alone is then presented to M. If M responds with the letter B, and M does this whenever A alone is said, then we have good evidence that MR has indeed learned the list AB. Thus M learns to predict the event B whenever the event A occurs as a result of repeated presentations of the list AB. We will introduce some mathematical machines that learn lists in the above manner. These machines have some properties that have a familiar intuitive interpretation. For example, in our simplest machine, it is possible to make rigorous the heuristic statements that (1) \"practice makes perfect,\" (2) an isolated system suffers no memory loss, (3) an isolated system remembers without practicing overtly, (4) the memory of an isolated system sometimes spontaneously improves without practice, (5) all errors can be corrected, although the rate of correction is sometimes diminished by response interference due to prior learning, (6) increasing the number of response alternatives sometimes diminishes the learning rate, and so on. All of the machines we will introduce possess the same dynamical laws. Nonetheless , the exact manner in which a given machine learns and remembers depends crucially on the particular way in which the components of the machine are interconnected ; i.e., on its \"geometry.\" For example, properties (2) and (3) above do not hold in all the machines we shall describe. In this note, we will sketch some results for our simplest machine. These results, along with results for more complicated machines, are described in greater detail in another place.' 2.

Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process.

However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT).

Objective To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15-day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Na\u00efve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939/4215, 46% of tweets) than negative (1349/4215, 32%) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phihookah-positive=0.39; phie-cigs-positive=0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (\u03c72 4=414.50, P<.001, Cramer\u2019s V=0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score=0.85). Conclusions Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 47, "citationCount": 299, "influentialCitationCount": 16, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2913436", "name": "Mark Mysl\u00edn"}, {"authorId": "32010307", "name": "Shu-Hong Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2640115", "name": "W.

But people can communicate objectives to each other simply by describing or demonstrating them. How can we build learning algorithms that will allow us to tell machines what we want them to do? In this work, we investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural network.

Numerous applications have demonstrated the feasibility and high efficiency of ELM-like systems. It has, however, been open if this is true for any general applications. In this two-part paper, we conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis of ELM. In Part I, we provide an answer to the question by theoretically justifying the following: 1) for some suitable activation functions, such as polynomials, Nadaraya-Watson and sigmoid functions, the ELM-like systems can attain the theoretical generalization bound of the FNNs with all connections adjusted, i.e., they do not degrade the generalization capability of the FNNs even when the connections with and within hidden neurons are randomly fixed; 2) the number of hidden neurons needed for an ELM-like system to achieve the theoretical bound can be estimated; and 3) whenever the activation function is taken as polynomial, the deduced hidden layer output matrix is of full column-rank, therefore the generalized inverse technique can be efficiently applied to yield the solution of an ELM-like system, and, furthermore, for the nonpolynomial case, the Tikhonov regularization can be applied to guarantee the weak regularity while not sacrificing the generalization capability. In Part II, however, we reveal a different aspect of the feasibility of ELM: there also exists some activation functions, which makes the corresponding ELM degrade the generalization capability.

Unfortunately, analysts who are knowledgeable in their field are typically not machine learning specialists. Most classification methods, however, require a certain expertise regarding their parametrization to achieve good results. Supervised machine learning algorithms, in contrast, rely on labeled data, which can be provided by analysts. However, the effort for labeling can be very high, which shifts the problem from composing complex queries or defining accurate filters to another laborious task, in addition to the need for judging the trained classifier's quality. We therefore compare three approaches for interactive classifier training in a user study. All of the approaches are potential candidates for the integration into a larger retrieval system. They incorporate active learning to various degrees in order to reduce the labeling effort as well as to increase effectiveness. Two of them encompass interactive visualization for letting users explore the status of the classifier in context of the labeled documents, as well as for judging the quality of the classifier in iterative feedback loops.

There is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end\u2010to\u2010end EEG analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for end\u2010to\u2010end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1% FBCSP, 84.0% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task\u2010related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG\u2010based brain mapping.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions.

To address these issues, we propose a method that follows a new paradigm by reformulating the detection problem as a behavior learning task for an artificial agent. We couple the modeling of the anatomy appearance and the object search in a unified behavioral framework, using the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and multi-scale image analysis. In other words, an artificial agent is trained not only to distinguish the target anatomical object from the rest of the body but also how to find the object by learning and following an optimal navigation path to the target object in the imaged volumetric space. We evaluated our approach on 1487 3D-CT volumes from 532 patients, totaling over 500,000 image slices and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on detecting several anatomical structures with no failed cases from a clinical acceptance perspective, while also achieving a 20-30 percent higher detection accuracy.

In this paper, we review the recent state of the art CAD technology for digitized histopathology. This paper also briefly describes the development and application of novel image analysis technology for a few specific histopathology related problems being pursued in the United States and Europe.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 144, "citationCount": 1448, "influentialCitationCount": 53, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5733445", "name": "M.

We consider a bandwidth-limited fading multiple access channel (MAC) from the wireless devices to the PS, and propose various techniques to implement distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) over this shared noisy wireless channel. We first propose a digital DSGD (D-DSGD) scheme, in which one device is selected opportunistically for transmission at each iteration based on the channel conditions; the scheduled device quantizes its gradient estimate to a finite number of bits imposed by the channel condition, and transmits these bits to the PS in a reliable manner. Next, motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose a novel analog communication scheme, referred to as the compressed analog DSGD (CA-DSGD), where the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates while accumulating error from previous iterations, and project the resultant sparse vector into a low-dimensional vector for bandwidth reduction. We also design a power allocation scheme to align the received gradient vectors at the PS in an efficient manner. Numerical results show that D-DSGD outperforms other digital approaches in the literature; however, in general the proposed CA-DSGD algorithm converges faster than the D-DSGD scheme, and reaches a higher level of accuracy. We have observed that the gap between the analog and digital schemes increases when the datasets of devices are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore, the performance of the CA-DSGD scheme is shown to be robust against imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Overall these results show clear advantages for the proposed analog over-the-air DSGD scheme, which suggests that learning and communication algorithms should be designed jointly to achieve the best end-to-end performance in machine learning applications at the wireless edge.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 274, "influentialCitationCount": 22, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2240170", "name": "M.

Though crowdsourcing has enabled annotation of large scale databases for real world images, its application for biomedical purposes requires a deeper understanding and hence, more precise definition of the actual annotation task. The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy?
