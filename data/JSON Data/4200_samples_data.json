These technologies allow multiple independent virtual machines to reside in apparent isolation on the same physical host. Dynamically scaling applications running on IaaS clouds can lead to varied and unpredictable results because of the performance interference effects associated with co\u2010located virtual machines. Determining appropriate scaling policies in a dynamic non\u2010stationary environment is non\u2010trivial. One principle advantage exhibited by IaaS clouds over their traditional hosting counterparts is the ability to scale resources on\u2010demand. However, a problem arises concerning resource allocation as to which resources should be added and removed when the underlying performance of the resource is in a constant state of flux. Decision theoretic frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes are particularly suited to decision making under uncertainty. By applying a temporal difference, reinforcement learning algorithm known as Q\u2010learning, optimal scaling policies can be determined. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques typically suffer from curse of dimensionality problems, where the state space grows exponentially with each additional state variable. To address this challenge, we also present a novel parallel Q\u2010learning approach aimed at reducing the time taken to determine optimal policies whilst learning online.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a particular type of deep, feedforward network that have gained attention from research community and industry, achieving empirical successes in tasks such as speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing and transfer learning. In this paper, we conduct some preliminary experiments using the deep learning approach to classify breast cancer histopathological images from BreaKHis, a publicly dataset available at http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. We propose a method based on the extraction of image patches for training the CNN and the combination of these patches for final classification. This method aims to allow using the high-resolution histopathological images from BreaKHis as input to existing CNN, avoiding adaptations of the model that can lead to a more complex and computationally costly architecture. The CNN performance is better when compared to previously reported results obtained by other machine learning models trained with hand-crafted textural descriptors.

In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error.

In this study, the anatomical information was characterized by the organ volumes and distance-to-target histogram (DTH). The database consists of 198 high quality prostate plans and was validated with 14 cases outside the training pool. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to DVHs and DTHs to quantify their salient features. Then, support vector regression (SVR) was implemented to establish the correlation between the features of the DVH and the anatomical information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDVH/DTH curves could be characterized sufficiently just using only two or three truncated principal components, thus, patient anatomical information was quantified with reduced numbers of variables. The evaluation of the model using the test data set demonstrated its accuracy approximately 80% in prediction and effectiveness in improving ART planning quality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn adaptive IMRT plan quality evaluation tool based on machine learning has been developed, which estimates OAR sparing and provides reference in evaluating ART.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 289, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2116208934", "name": "Xiaofeng Zhu"}, {"authorId": "37007400", "name": "Y.

Specifically, we propose ensemble distillation for model fusion, i.e. training the central classifier through unlabeled data on the outputs of the models from the clients. This knowledge distillation technique mitigates privacy risk and cost to the same extent as the baseline FL algorithms, but allows flexible aggregation over heterogeneous client models that can differ e.g. in size, numerical precision or structure.

Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closedform mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to introduce a random forests (RFs)-based prognostic method for tool wear prediction as well as compare the performance of RFs with feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) ANNs and SVR. Specifically, the performance of FFBP ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental data collected from 315 milling tests. Experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than FFBP ANNs with a single hidden layer and SVR.

Conventional techniques usually focus on visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination.

However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants are most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. In extreme cases, this can also lead to long-term conditions, such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning difficulties, including poor health and growth. In the US alone, the societal and economic cost of preterm births, in 2005, was estimated to be $26.2 billion, per annum. In the UK, this value was close to \u00a32.95 billion, in 2009. Many believe that a better understanding of why preterm births occur, and a strategic focus on prevention, will help to improve the health of children and reduce healthcare costs. At present, most methods of preterm birth prediction are subjective. However, a strong body of evidence suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals (Electrohysterography), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and predict preterm deliveries. Most Electrohysterography studies focus on true labour detection during the final seven days, before labour. The challenge is to utilise Electrohysterography techniques to predict preterm delivery earlier in the pregnancy. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies term and preterm records, using an open source dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to oversample the minority preterm class, and cross validation techniques, are used to evaluate the dataset against other similar studies.

We are seeking to develop a computer system for powerful and reliable cancer diagnostic model creation based on microarray data. To keep a realistic perspective on clinical applications we focus on multicategory diagnosis. To equip the system with the optimum combination of classifier, gene selection and cross-validation methods, we performed a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of several major algorithms for multicategory classification, several gene selection methods, multiple ensemble classifier methods and two cross-validation designs using 11 datasets spanning 74 diagnostic categories and 41 cancer types and 12 normal tissue types.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMulticategory support vector machines (MC-SVMs) are the most effective classifiers in performing accurate cancer diagnosis from gene expression data. The MC-SVM techniques by Crammer and Singer, Weston and Watkins and one-versus-rest were found to be the best methods in this domain. MC-SVMs outperform other popular machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, backpropagation and probabilistic neural networks, often to a remarkable degree. Gene selection techniques can significantly improve the classification performance of both MC-SVMs and other non-SVM learning algorithms. Ensemble classifiers do not generally improve performance of the best non-ensemble models. These results guided the construction of a software system GEMS (Gene Expression Model Selector) that automates high-quality model construction and enforces sound optimization and performance estimation procedures. This is the first such system to be informed by a rigorous comparative analysis of the available algorithms and datasets.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe software system GEMS is available for download from http://www.gems-system.org for non-commercial use.\n\n\nCONTACT\nalexander.statnikov@vanderbilt.edu.", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 90, "citationCount": 859, "influentialCitationCount": 56, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1702228", "name": "A.

The main research in this area relates to the design choices for feature representation and for effective decompositions of the task in different learning models. Regarding the former choice, structural properties of full syntactic parses are largely employed as they represent ways to encode different principles suggested by the linking theory between syntax and semantics. The latter choice relates to several learning schemes over global views of the parses. For example, re-ranking stages operating over alternative predicate-argument sequences of the same sentence have shown to be very effective. In this article, we propose several kernel functions to model parse tree properties in kernel-based machines, for example, perceptrons or support vector machines. In particular, we define different kinds of tree kernels as general approaches to feature engineering in SRL. Moreover, we extensively experiment with such kernels to investigate their contribution to individual stages of an SRL architecture both in isolation and in combination with other traditional manually coded features. The results for boundary recognition, classification, and re-ranking stages provide systematic evidence about the significant impact of tree kernels on the overall accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is small.

With the recent cataloging of thousands of acetylation sites on hundreds of proteins comes the challenge of identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that regulate acetylation levels. Sirtuins are a conserved family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. SIRT3 is the dominant protein deacetylase in mitochondria, and emerging evidence suggests that SIRT3 may control major pathways by deacetylation of central metabolic enzymes. Here, to identify potential SIRT3 substrates, we have developed an unbiased screening strategy that involves a novel acetyl-lysine analogue (thiotrifluoroacetyl-lysine), SPOT-peptide libraries, machine learning, and kinetic validation. SPOT peptide libraries based on known and potential mitochondrial acetyl-lysine sites were screened for SIRT3 binding and then analyzed using machine learning to establish binding trends. These trends were then applied to the mitochondrial proteome as a whole to predict binding affinity of all lysine sites within human mitochondria. Machine learning prediction of SIRT3 binding correlated with steady-state kinetic k(cat)/K(m) values for 24 acetyl-lysine peptides that possessed a broad range of predicted binding. Thus, SPOT peptide-binding screens and machine learning prediction provides an accurate and efficient method to evaluate sirtuin substrate specificity from a relatively small learning set.

In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks.

In this paper, we propose a new active learning-based approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules.

HBP can also selectively and non-covalently interact with hormone. Therefore, accurate identification of HBP is an important prerequisite for understanding its biological functions and molecular mechanisms. Since experimental methods are still labor intensive and cost ineffective to identify HBP, it's necessary to develop computational methods to accurately and efficiently identify HBP. In this paper, a machine learning-based method was proposed to identify HBP, in which the samples were encoded by using the optimal tripeptide composition obtained based on the binomial distribution method. In the 5-fold cross-validation test, the proposed method yielded an overall accuracy of 97.15%.

The availability of an automated computer analysis tool that is more objective than human readers can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. A computer\u2010assisted classification method combining conventional MRI and perfusion MRI is developed and used for differential diagnosis. The proposed scheme consists of several steps including region\u2010of\u2010interest definition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The extracted features include tumor shape and intensity characteristics, as well as rotation invariant texture features. Feature subset selection is performed using support vector machines with recursive feature elimination. The method was applied on a population of 102 brain tumors histologically diagnosed as metastasis ( 24 ), meningiomas ( 4 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade II ( 22 ), gliomas World Health Organization grade III ( 18 ), and glioblastomas ( 34 ). The binary support vector machine classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, assessed by leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation, were, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 79% for discrimination of metastases from gliomas and 88%, 85%, and 96% for discrimination of high\u2010grade (grades III and IV) from low\u2010grade (grade II) neoplasms. Multiclass classification was also performed via a one\u2010vs\u2010all voting scheme.
