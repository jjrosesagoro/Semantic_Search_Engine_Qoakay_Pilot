Demand for scaling up machine learning is task-specific: for some tasks it is driven by the enormous dataset sizes, for others by model complexity or by the requirement for real-time prediction. Selecting a task-appropriate parallelization platform and algorithm requires understanding their benefits, trade-offs and constraints. This tutorial focuses on providing an integrated overview of state-of-the-art platforms and algorithm choices. These span a range of hardware options (from FPGAs and GPUs to multi-core systems and commodity clusters), programming frameworks (including CUDA, MPI, MapReduce, and DryadLINQ), and learning settings (e.g., semi-supervised and online learning). The tutorial is example-driven, covering a number of popular algorithms (e.g., boosted trees, spectral clustering, belief propagation) and diverse applications (e.g., recommender systems and object recognition in vision).\n The tutorial is based on (but not limited to) the material from our upcoming Cambridge U.

Broadly speaking \u201cmachine learning\u201d refers to computer algorithms that have the ability to \u201clearn\u201d or improve in performance over time on some task. In general, machine learning algorithms are designed to detect patterns in data and then apply these patterns going forward to new data in order to automate particular tasks. Outside of law, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to automate tasks that were once thought to necessitate human intelligence \u2014 for example language translation, fraud-detection, driving automobiles, facial recognition, and data-mining. If performing well, machine learning algorithms can produce automated results that approximate those that would have been made by a similarly situated person.This Article begins by explaining some basic principles underlying machine learning methods, in a manner accessible to non-technical audiences. The second part explores a broader puzzle: legal practice is thought to require advanced cognitive abilities, but such higher-order cognition remains outside the capability of current machine-learning technology. This part identifies a core principle: how certain tasks that are normally thought to require human intelligence can sometimes be automated through the use of non-intelligent computational techniques that employ heuristics or proxies (e.g., statistical correlations) capable of producing useful, \u201cintelligent\u201d results.

We develop a new algorithm based on the multiple-instance learning framework and the naive Bayesian classifier (mi-NB) which is specifically designed for the low false-alarm case, and is shown to have promising performance. Other methods compared are support vector machines (SVMs), unsupervised clustering, and non-parametric statistical tests (rank-sum and reverse arrangements). The failure-prediction performance of the SVM, rank-sum and mi-NB algorithm is considerably better than the threshold method currently implemented in drives, while maintaining low false alarm rates. Our results suggest that nonparametric statistical tests should be considered for learning problems involving detecting rare events in time series data.

One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called \u201chealth factors,\u201d or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs.

Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky.

Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations.

Science, this issue p. 1026 A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information. For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions.

This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially. The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence.

The kernel is straightforward to evaluate for all exponential family models such as multinomials and Gaussians and yields interesting nonlinear kernels. Furthermore, the kernel is computable in closed form for latent distributions such as mixture models, hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems. For intractable models, such as switching linear dynamical systems, structured mean-field approximations can be brought to bear on the kernel evaluation. For general distributions, even if an analytic expression for the kernel is not feasible, we show a straightforward sampling method to evaluate it.

Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance.

In contrast, interactive machine learning engages users in actually generating the classifier themselves. This offers a natural way of integrating background knowledge into the modelling stage\u2014as long as interactive tools can be designed that support efficient and effective communication. This paper shows that appropriate techniques can empower users to create models that compete with classifiers built by state-of-the-art learning algorithms. It demonstrates that users\u2014even users who are not domain experts\u2014can often construct good classifiers, without any help from a learning algorithm, using a simple two-dimensional visual interface. Experiments on real data demonstrate that, not surprisingly, success hinges on the domain: if a few attributes can support good predictions, users generate accurate classifiers, whereas domains with many high-order attribute interactions favour standard machine learning techniques. We also present an artificial example where domain knowledge allows an \u201cexpert user\u201d to create a much more accurate model than automatic learning algorithms. These results indicate that our system has the potential to produce highly accurate classifiers in the hands of a domain expert who has a strong interest in the domain and therefore some insights into how to partition the data.

The book makes four main contributions to the fields of machine learning and multiagent systems. \nFirst, it describes an architecture within which a flexible team structure allows member agents to decompose a task into flexible roles and to switch roles while acting. Second, it presents layered learning, a general-purpose machine-learning method for complex domains in which learning a mapping directly from agents' sensors to their actuators is intractable with existing machine-learning methods. Third, the book introduces a new multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm--team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL)--designed for domains in which agents cannot necessarily observe the state-changes caused by other agents' actions. The final contribution is a fully functioning multiagent system that incorporates learning in a real-time, noisy domain with teammates and adversaries--a computer-simulated robotic soccer team. \nPeter Stone's work is the basis for the CMUnited Robotic Soccer Team, which has dominated recent RoboCup competitions.

Our method is orthogonal to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused on making the classification network itself more robust. We show empirically that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though they are quasi-imperceptible to humans.

In a goal-oriented dialogue scenario, these latent intentions can be interpreted as actions guiding the generation of machine responses, which can be further refined autonomously by reinforcement learning.

Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging.

Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors (incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five healthcare datasets.

Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period.

This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation.

A constant sfream of data bombards our senses and millions of sensory channels carry information into our brains. Brains are also learning machines that condition, combine, parse, and store data. Is it possible to learn something about learning by observing the style of computation used by brains? This is the motivation for research into computational devices that today are called \"neural networks.\" Neural networks are nonlinear dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom that can be used to solve computational problems. The mathematical foundations for learning in this class of machines was laid by agroup of researchers in the 1940s and 1950s. The achievement documented in this book is the thorough study of one of the simplest members of this class, feedforward networks with one layer of m w ~ a b l e weights connecting input units to output units. In a sense, these might be called reflex machines. The knee-jerk reflex, for example, is mediated by synaptic connections from the sensory recepton in your knee directly onto rnotoneurons in your spinal cord that in turn activate leg muscles. There are limits to how much computation can be accomplished by such reflexes, and these limits have been carefully delineated in this book. Just as more complex creatures evolved by layering control loops on the primitive reflexes, network models have also evolved in recent years and now have achieved vastly greater capabilities than reflex machines by making use of multilayered architectures with feedback connections. Nonetheless, recent work could not have been accomplished without building on these foundations. vii viil INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION ix Despite the early promise of research on neural networks, there was a period of about 20 years, from the mid 1960s to the mid 1980s. when interest in neural networks as computational devices and models of human behavior waned in favor of models based on symbol processing. There are many reasons for this, some of them now evident in this book. Still, Learning Machines was an underground classic among the neural network modelers who were active during this \"dark age\" and deserves to be better known to the generation that is \"relearning\" what was once known about statistical learning machines. The intuitive geometric explanations and the mathematical foundations in this monograph are as invaluable today as they were when it was first written.

Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field. Radiologists should become familiar with the principles and potential applications of deep learning in medical imaging. \u00a9RSNA, 2017.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 583, "influentialCitationCount": 14, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38162399", "name": "G.

Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent based approaches. We analyze the convergence rate of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best trade-off between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment. The experimentation results show that our proposed approach performs near to the optimum with various machine learning models and different data distributions.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 305, "influentialCitationCount": 19, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "50695457", "name": "Shiqiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "40917131", "name": "Tiffany Tuor"}, {"authorId": "2522394", "name": "Theodoros Salonidis"}, {"authorId": "145353889", "name": "K.
