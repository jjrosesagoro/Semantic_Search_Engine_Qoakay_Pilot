The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization.

Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\\it instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100.

In \u201cThe Future of Data Analysis,\u201d he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or \u201cdata analysis.\u201d Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name \u201cdata science\u201d for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of \u201cdata science\u201d programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M \u201cData Science Initiative\u201d that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d This article reviews some ingredients of the current \u201cdata science moment,\u201d including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for \u201cscaling up\u201d to \u201cbig data.\u201d This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere \u201cscaling up,\u201d but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are \u201clearning from data,\u201d and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today\u2019s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

In this paper, we present DeepEar -- the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices.

Additional features that are uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier.

While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing---synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone. We applied our methodology using the Open Directory Project, the largest existing Web directory built by over 70,000 human editors.

The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples.

In this study, we describe a new approach called positive sample only learning (PSoL) to predict ncRNA genes in the Escherichia coli genome. Although PSoL is a machine learning method for classification, it requires no negative training data, which, in general, is hard to define properly and affects the performance of machine learning dramatically. In addition, using the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learning algorithm, PSoL can integrate many different kinds of information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Besides the application of PSoL for predicting ncRNAs, PSoL is applicable to many other bioinformatics problems as well.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PSoL method is assessed by 5-fold cross-validation experiments which show that PSoL can achieve about 80% accuracy in recovery of known ncRNAs.

This paper proposes a novel EMG classifier called cascaded kernel learning machine (CKLM) to achieve the goal of high-accuracy EMG recognition. First, the EMG signals are acquired by three surface electrodes placed on three different muscles. Second, EMG features are extracted by autoregressive model (ARM) and EMG histogram. After the feature extraction, the CKLM is performed to classify the features. CKLM is composed of two different kinds of kernel learning machines: generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). By using GDA, both the goals of the dimensionality reduction of input features and the selection of discriminating features, named kernel FisherEMG, can be reached. Then, SVM combined with one-against-one strategy is executed to classify the kernel FisherEMG. By cascading SVM with GDA, the input features will be nonlinearly mapped twice by radial-basis function (RBF). As a result, a linear optimal separating hyperplane can be found with the largest margin of separation between each pair of postures' classes in the implicit dot product feature space. In addition, we develop a digital signal processor (DSP)-based EMG classification system for the control of a multi-degrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand for the practical implementation. Based on the clinical experiments, the results show that the proposed CKLM is superior to other frequently used methods, such as k-nearest neighbor algorithm, multilayer neural network, and SVM.

We build upon existing view synthesis techniques and break down the process into disparity and color estimation components. We use two sequential convolutional neural networks to model these two components and train both networks simultaneously by minimizing the error between the synthesized and ground truth images. We show the performance of our approach using only four corner sub-aperture views from the light fields captured by the Lytro Illum camera. Experimental results show that our approach synthesizes high-quality images that are superior to the state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of challenging real-world scenes.

These systems attempt to find the perfect match between the user fingerprint and pre-defined set of grid points on the radio map. However, Fingerprints are duplicated from available Access Points (APs) and interference, which increase number of matched patterns with the user's fingerprint. In this research, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to improve the performance and to reduce the computation cost of the WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach.

However, CTA generally overestimates stenosis severity compared with invasive angiography, and angiographic stenosis does not necessarily imply hemodynamic relevance when fractional flow reserve (FFR) is used as reference. CTA-based FFR (CT-FFR), using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), improves the correlation with invasive FFR results but is computationally demanding. More recently, a new machine-learning (ML) CT-FFR algorithm has been developed based on a deep learning model, which can be performed on a regular workstation. In this large multicenter cohort, the diagnostic performance ML-based CT-FFR was compared with CTA and CFD-based CT-FFR for detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: At 5 centers in Europe, Asia, and the United States, 351 patients, including 525 vessels with invasive FFR comparison, were included. ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR were performed on the CTA data, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using invasive FFR as reference. Correlation between ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR was excellent (R=0.997). ML-based (area under curve, 0.84) and CFD-based CT-FFR (0.84) outperformed visual CTA (0.69; P<0.0001). On a per-vessel basis, diagnostic accuracy improved from 58% (95% confidence interval, 54%\u201363%) by CTA to 78% (75%\u201382%) by ML-based CT-FFR. The per-patient accuracy improved from 71% (66%\u201376%) by CTA to 85% (81%\u201389%) by adding ML-based CT-FFR as 62 of 85 (73%) false-positive CTA results could be correctly reclassified by adding ML-based CT-FFR.

But these are hard to use in practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of limited use for practitioners. We propose a reparametrisation of the alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which, together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply changing the loss of the model.

The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to damage at the very earliest stages of AD.

Regional changes of bilateral hippocampi were characterized using computational anatomic mapping methods. A feature selection method for support vector machine and leave-1-out cross-validation was introduced to determine regional shape differences that minimized the error rate in the datasets. RESULTS: Patients with AD showed significant deformations in the CA1 region of bilateral hippocampi, as well as the subiculum of the left hippocampus. There were also some changes in the CA2\u20134 subregions of the left hippocampus among patients with AD. Moreover, the left hippocampal surface showed greater variations than the right compared with those in healthy control subjects. The accuracies of leave-1-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation experiments for assessing the reliability of these subregions were more than 80% in bilateral hippocampi.

We propose a wearable assistant, composed of a smartphone and wearable accelerometers, for online detection of FoG. The system is based on machine learning techniques for automatic detection of FoG episodes. When FoG is detected, the assistant provides rhythmic auditory cueing or vibrotactile feedback that stimulates the patient to resume walking.

We characterize the system performance on user-dependent and user-independent experiments, with respect to different machine learning algorithms, sensor placement and preprocessing window size.

It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BOOSTMETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. BOOSTMETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classifier or regressor.

The two problems we consider are: (1) determination of whether procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA sequences segments are translated to protein. An accuracy of 99.4% is reported for procaryotic DNA (E. coli) and 98.4% for eucaryotic DNA (H. Sapiens genes known to be expressed in liver); (2) determination of whether eucaryotic DNA sequence segments containing the dinucleotides ''AG'' or ''GT'' are transcribed to RNA splice junctions. Accuracy of 91.2% was achieved on intron/exon splice junctions (acceptor sites) and 92.8% on exon/intron splice junctions (donor sites). The solution of these two problems, by use of information processing algorithms operating on unannotated base sequences and without recourse to biological laboratory work, is relevant to the Human Genome Project. A variety of neural network, machine learning, and information theoretic algorithms are used. The accuracies obtained exceed those of previous investigations for which quantitative results are available in the literature. They result from an ongoing program of research that applies machine learning algorithms to the problem of determining biological function of DNA sequences.

The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures.

A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self-adaptive, and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of ML, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive.

Our key technical contribution is an analytical solution to the problem of computing the optimal step size at each iteration, using an efficient method that requires only O(1) communication cost to ensure fast convergence. With this optimal step size, our approach is superior to other methods by possessing global linear convergence, or, equivalently, O(log(1/e)) iteration complexity for an e-accurate solution, for distributedly solving the non-strongly-convex linear SVM dual problem.

Extending traditional database systems to support the above analysis is intriguing but challenging. First, it is almost impossible to implement all machine learning models in the database engines. Second, expertise knowledge is required to optimize the training and inference procedures in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, which imposes heavy burden on the system users. In this paper, we develop and present a system, called Rafiki, to provide the training and inference service of machine learning models, and facilitate complex analytics on top of cloud platforms.

Restraining or restricting the environment of the animal can simplify automatic behavior quantification, but it can also degrade the quality or alter important aspects of behavior. To enable biologists to design experiments to obtain better behavioral measurements, and computer scientists to pinpoint fruitful directions for algorithm improvement, we review known effects of artificial manipulation of the animal on behavior.

This relaxation permits straight-through optimization of any computational graph involve a sorting operation. Further, we use this relaxation to enable gradient-based stochastic optimization over the combinatorially large space of permutations by deriving a reparameterized gradient estimator for the Plackett-Luce family of distributions over permutations.
