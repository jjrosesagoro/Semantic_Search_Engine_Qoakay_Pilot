Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general\u2010purpose methods.

Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery, we devised PixelDefend, a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier, making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result, PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed.

This paper proposes a novel EMG classifier called cascaded kernel learning machine (CKLM) to achieve the goal of high-accuracy EMG recognition. First, the EMG signals are acquired by three surface electrodes placed on three different muscles. Second, EMG features are extracted by autoregressive model (ARM) and EMG histogram. After the feature extraction, the CKLM is performed to classify the features. CKLM is composed of two different kinds of kernel learning machines: generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). By using GDA, both the goals of the dimensionality reduction of input features and the selection of discriminating features, named kernel FisherEMG, can be reached. Then, SVM combined with one-against-one strategy is executed to classify the kernel FisherEMG. By cascading SVM with GDA, the input features will be nonlinearly mapped twice by radial-basis function (RBF). As a result, a linear optimal separating hyperplane can be found with the largest margin of separation between each pair of postures' classes in the implicit dot product feature space. In addition, we develop a digital signal processor (DSP)-based EMG classification system for the control of a multi-degrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand for the practical implementation.

Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to a number of real world problems, such as data mining, game playing, medical diagnosis, speech recognition and automated control. Reinforcement learning provides an approach in which an agent interacts with the environment and learns by trial and error rather than from direct training examples. In other words, the learning task is specified by rewards and penalties that indirectly tell the agent what it is supposed to do instead of telling it how to accomplish the task. In this article we outline a framework for applying reinforcement learning to optimize the performance of conventional garbage collectors. In this project we have researched an adaptive decision process that makes decisions regarding which garbage collector technique should be invoked and how it should be applied. The decision is based on information about the memory allocation behavior of currently running applications. The system learns through trial and error to take the optimal actions in an initially unknown environment.", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 20, "citationCount": 27, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2071306422", "name": "Eva Andreasson"}, {"authorId": "143762003", "name": "F.

Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API.

In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction.

The multi-view SVMs tracking method is constructed based on multiple views of features and a novel combination strategy.

In order to realize the combination of the SVMs under the multi-view learning framework, we present a novel collaborative strategy with entropy criterion, which is acquired by the confidence distribution of the candidate samples.

It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BOOSTMETRIC, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and is not easy to implement. BOOSTMETRIC is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classifier or regressor.

A cross-sectional database study. Objective. The aim of this study was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion. Summary of Background Data. Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery. Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class\u200a\u22653, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the accuracy of our machine learning models. Results. On the basis of AUC values, ANN and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound complications and mortality. Conclusion. Machine learning in the form of logistic regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine surgery.

The long-term goal of an APM system is to maximize the battery life while minimizing the annoyance to the user. The state-of-the-art in commercial solutions is timeout policies. These policies switch components into their low power states based on thresholds of periods of inactivity. Unfortunately, such methods not only waste power during the periods of inactivity, but also needlessly annoy the user when they turn off components at inappropriate times. Research in APM, on the other hand, has focused more on modeling system dynamics and not on usage patterns. We propose a system that learns when to turn off components based on different user patterns. We describe the challenges of building such a system and progressively explore a range of solutions. We experiment with a direct approach that predicts when to turn off a component given usage features (e.g., historical keyboard and mouse activity, active application, history of network traffic, and history of CPU utilization). To improve performance of the direct approach we partition data based on the context and train the learning algorithms separately for each context. Context could be past idleness or any partitioning of the data that improves performance. We then propose a model-based approach that captures the temporal dynamic of system and user state, the cost of power and user annoyance, as well as the effect of power-saving actions on the user and system. Our direct approach is validated on a large data corpus collected from multiple real users where results show a considerable improvement over traditional timeout methods. INTRODUCTION Adaptive Power Management (APM) attempts to increase the perceived battery life of a laptop by turning off certain components when their services are not going to be needed. Of course, it is not known in advance which services will be needed and when. Moreover, the perceived impact of having certain services not available is much greater than the perceived impact of others. The goal of APM is to extend the battery life as much as possible with an acceptable perceived loss of performance. APM, as opposed to non-adaptive power management, attempts to make better decisions with time and to adapt to individual users. APM is an example of an autonomic system. The autonomics concept is derived from the human body\u2019s autonomic nervous system that regulates individual organ function, and for the most part is not subject to voluntary control. An autonomic computing system controls the functioning of computer applications or systems without explicit user input. The goal of autonomic computing is to create systems that are self-managing, self-healing, and self-protecting. Autonomic computing promises to reduce expenditures associated with operations, maintenance, and support, and to significantly improve the end user\u2019s experience. Autonomic systems ensure smooth and uninterrupted operation by monitoring the system state, diagnosing problems, identifying user context, and executing actions to fix the problems. For example, an APM system monitors the user and laptop state, diagnoses the user mood or context, and changes power states such that the user is not noticeably impacted. Autonomic systems need to naturally reason about uncertainty in both perception Intel Technology Journal, Volume 10, Issue 4, 2006 Machine Learning for Adaptive Power Management 300 and action. In an APM system, perception uncertainty arises from the fact that the user context cannot be directly observed from sensors, such as keyboard and mouse activity, or the currently active application. Actions that turn off components also generate uncertainty. They create uncertainty in terms of the time it takes to turn a component on and off and in terms of the effect it would have on the user\u2019s context. For example, placing the machine on standby does not always take the same amount of time and sometimes the Operating System (OS) does not even allow it. If the user context is for example a measure of idleness, then going to standby, could either increase idleness if it succeeds or decrease it if it fails, hence the uncertainty. If the user context is a measure of the users\u2019 mode of operation (e.g., working, browsing for fun) then going to standby could again change the context in an unpredictable manner. Modeling real-world phenomena as stochastic processes and sequential decision-making under uncertainty (see Figure 1) are widely used paradigms in artificial intelligence. The process of estimating these stochastic process models and the computation of optimal policies fall into the category of machine learning. Machine learning refers to the problem of constructing computer programs that automatically improve with experience. The simplest class of machine learning algorithms are classifiers, which are functions that learn (from examples) to map input patterns to output classes. For the APM domain, our algorithms learn to map laptop usage patterns (at the OS level) into power management actions as shown in Figure 2. In this paper, we first summarize past approaches to the APM problem and then describe a machine-learning approach that maps user patterns to power-saving sections. Our approach outperforms current commercial solutions such as timeout policies. We then propose a more general model-based approach that relies on building stochastic process models. We finally discuss the potential application of such models to other domains. Figure 1: A classic sequential decision-making task under uncertainty. The doctor performs treatments and diagnostic tests on the patient, which change in a stochastic manner the internal state of the patient. The doctor then observes symptoms. The optimal policy is one where in the long run the patient is made well.

Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this problem. Methods and Results We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using a 13\u2010year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD\u2010free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC/AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5% 10\u2010year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8% of the 480 \u201cHard CVD\u201d events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71.

Similar results were found for prediction of \u201cAll CVD\u201d events.

Recently, these techniques have also gained popularity in the system identification community. In both linear and nonlinear settings, kernels that incorporate information on dynamic systems, such as the smoothness and stability of the input\u2013output map, can challenge consolidated approaches based on parametric model structures. In the classical parametric setting, the complexity of the model (the model order) needs to be chosen, typically from a finite family of alternatives, by trading bias and variance. This (discrete) model order selection step may be critical, especially when the true model does not belong to the model class. In regularization-based approaches, model complexity is controlled by tuning (continuous) regularization parameters, making the model selection step more robust.

However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning.

To this end, various established problems with statistical inference applied in geographical settings are reviewed, based on Gould's (1970) critique. Possible solutions to the problems outlined by Gould are suggested via reviews of: (i) improved statistical methods, and (ii) recent inductive machine learning techniques. Following this, some newer problems with inference are described, emerging from the increased complexity of geographical datasets and from the analysis tasks to which we put them. Again, some solutions are suggested by pointing to newer methods. By way of results, questions are posed, and answered, relating to the changes brought about by adopting inductive machine learning methods for geographical analysis. Specifically, these questions relate to analysis capabilities, methodologies, the role of the geographer and consequences for teaching and learning.
