An important disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield. We identify a number of parameters that influence the obtainable speedups, and validate and refine our analysis with experiments on a variety of data sets with two different implementations. Besides cross-validation, we also briefly explore the usefulness of these techniques for bagging.

For this task a key enabler is a robust detection and classification of the plant and species. Automatically distinguishing between plant species is a challenging task, because some species look very similar. It is also difficult to translate the symbolic high level description of the appearances and the differences between the plants used by humans, into a formal, computer understandable form. Also it is not possible to reliably detect structures, like leaves and branches in 3D data provided by our sensor. One approach to solve this problem is to learn how to classify the species by using a set of example plants and machine learning methods. In this paper we are introducing a method for distinguishing plant species using a 3D LIDAR sensor and supervised learning. For that we have developed a set of size and rotation invariant features and evaluated experimentally which are the most descriptive ones. Besides these features we have also compared different learning methods using the toolbox Weka. It turned out that the best methods for our application are simple logistic regression functions, support vector machines and neural networks. In our experiments we used six different plant species, typically available at common nurseries, and about 20 examples of each species.

Objective This study aims to report a quality improvement effort to integrate a deep learning sepsis detection and management platform, Sepsis Watch, into routine clinical care. Methods In 2016, a multidisciplinary team consisting of statisticians, data scientists, data engineers, and clinicians was assembled by the leadership of an academic health system to radically improve the detection and treatment of sepsis. This report of the quality improvement effort follows the learning health system framework to describe the problem assessment, design, development, implementation, and evaluation plan of Sepsis Watch. Results Sepsis Watch was successfully integrated into routine clinical care and reshaped how local machine learning projects are executed. Frontline clinical staff were highly engaged in the design and development of the workflow, machine learning model, and application. Novel machine learning methods were developed to detect sepsis early, and implementation of the model required robust infrastructure. Significant investment was required to align stakeholders, develop trusting relationships, define roles and responsibilities, and to train frontline staff, leading to the establishment of 3 partnerships with internal and external research groups to evaluate Sepsis Watch. Conclusions Machine learning models are commonly developed to enhance clinical decision making, but successful integrations of machine learning into routine clinical care are rare. Although there is no playbook for integrating deep learning into clinical care, learnings from the Sepsis Watch integration can inform efforts to develop machine learning technologies at other health care delivery systems.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "47057856", "name": "M.

While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs.

Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements.

When data is scarce, knowledge can be farmed from seeds; i.e. minimal and partial descriptions of a domain. These seeds can be grown into large datasets via Monte Carlo simulations. The datasets can then be harvested using machine learning techniques. Examples of this knowledge farming approach, and the associated technique of data-mining, is given from numerous software engineering domains. Machine learning (ML) is not hard. Machine learners automatically generate summaries of data or existing systems in a smaller form. Software engineers can use machine learners to simplify systems development. This chapter explains how to use ML to assist in the construction of systems that support classification, prediction, diagnosis, planning, monitoring, requirements engineering, validation, and maintenance. This chapter approaches machine learning with three specific biases. First, we will explore machine learning in data-starved domains. Machine learning is typically proposed for domains that contain large datasets. Our experience strongly suggests that many domains lack such large datasets. This lack of data is particularly acute for newer, smaller software companies. Such companies lack the resources to collect and maintain such data. Also, they have not been developing products long enough to collect an appropriately large dataset. When we cannot mine data, we show how to farm knowledge by growing datasets from domain models. Second, we will only report mature machine learning methods; i.e. those methods which do not require highly specialized skills to execute. This second bias rules out some of the more exciting work on the leading edge of machine learning research (e.g. horn-clause learning). Third, in the author\u2019s view, it has yet to be shown empirically from realistic examples that a particular learning technique is necessarily better than the others . When faced with arguably equivalent techniques, Occam\u2019s razor suggests we use the simplest. We hence will explore simple decision tree learners in this chapter. Decision tree learners execute very quickly and are widely used: many of the practical SE applications of machine learning use decision tree learners like C4.5 [33] or the CART For evidence of this statement, see the comparisons of different learning methods in [34, 17, 36]", "year": 2000, "referenceCount": 15, "citationCount": 37, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1703872", "name": "T.

Assistive technology and health informatics are fields for which minor improvements achieved through leveraging more advanced machine learning algorithms can translate to major real world impact. However, successful application of machine learning currently requires broad domain knowledge to determine which model is appropriate for a given task, and model specific expertise to configure a model to a problem of interest. A major motivation for this thesis was: How can we make machine learning more accessible to assistive technology and health informatics researchers? Naturally, a complementary goal is to make machine learning more accessible in general. Specifically, in this thesis we explore how to automate the role of a machine learning expert through automatically adapting models and adjusting parameters to a given task of interest. This thesis consists of a number of contributions towards solving this challenging open problem in machine learning and these are empirically validated on four real-world applications. Through an interesting theoretical link between two seemingly disparate latent variable models, we create a hybrid model that allows one to flexibly interpolate over a parametric unsupervised neural network, a classification neural network and a non-parametric Gaussian process.

Smartphones can measure PD features, yet no smartphone-derived rating score exists to assess motor symptom severity in real-world settings. Objectives To develop an objective measure of PD severity and test construct validity by evaluating the ability of the measure to capture intraday symptom fluctuations, correlate with current standard PD outcome measures, and respond to dopaminergic therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational study assessed individuals with PD who remotely completed 5 tasks (voice, finger tapping, gait, balance, and reaction time) on the smartphone application. We used a novel machine-learning\u2013based approach to generate a mobile Parkinson disease score (mPDS) that objectively weighs features derived from each smartphone activity (eg, stride length from the gait activity) and is scaled from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater severity). Individuals with and without PD additionally completed standard in-person assessments of PD with smartphone assessments during a period of 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures Ability of the mPDS to detect intraday symptom fluctuations, the correlation between the mPDS and standard measures, and the ability of the mPDS to respond to dopaminergic medication. Results The mPDS was derived from 6148 smartphone activity assessments from 129 individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.6] years; 56 [43.4%] women). Gait features contributed most to the total mPDS (33.4%). In addition, 23 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [11.5] years; 11 [48%] women) and 17 without PD (mean [SD] age 54.2 [16.5] years; 12 [71%] women) completed in-clinic assessments. The mPDS detected symptom fluctuations with a mean (SD) intraday change of 13.9 (10.3) points on a scale of 0 to 100. The measure correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease\u2019s Rating Scale total (r\u2009=\u20090.81; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and part III only (r\u2009=\u20090.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001), the Timed Up and Go assessment (r\u2009=\u20090.72; P\u2009=\u2009.002), and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r\u2009=\u20090.91; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mPDS improved by a mean (SD) of 16.3 (5.6) points in response to dopaminergic therapy.

In this paper, we present DeepEar -- the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices. Finally, we show DeepEar is feasible for smartphones by building a cloud-free DSP-based prototype that runs continuously, using only 6% of the smartphone's battery daily.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 83, "citationCount": 318, "influentialCitationCount": 15, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144948031", "name": "N.

In this study, we proposed novel approaches for lead detection using two machine learning algorithms: decision trees and random forest. CryoSat-2 satellite data collected in March and April of 2011\u20132014 over the Arctic region were used to extract waveform parameters that show the characteristics of leads, ice floes and ocean, including stack standard deviation, stack skewness, stack kurtosis, pulse peakiness and backscatter sigma-0.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization.

With this approach we predict time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) excited state energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the Fenna\u2013Matthews\u2013Olson (FMO) complex. Additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations from the predictions. Different methods to determine multi-layer perceptron training sets are introduced, leading to several initial data selections. In addition, we compute spectral densities and exciton populations. Once multi-layer perceptrons are trained, predicting excited state energies was found to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We showed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of QM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors contained within 0.01 eV (0.5%). Spectral densities and exciton dynamics are also in agreement with the TDDFT results.

Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models--models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data--and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier.

Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array.

While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing---synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone. We applied our methodology using the Open Directory Project, the largest existing Web directory built by over 70,000 human editors.

In this paper, we explore support vector machines (SVMs), which are a class of supervised kernel methods that provide interpretable decision functions. We find that SVMs can learn the mathematical form of physical discriminators, such as order parameters and Hamiltonian constraints, for a set of two-dimensional spin models: the ferromagnetic Ising model, a conserved-order-parameter Ising model, and the Ising gauge theory.

Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\\it instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100. Although assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to outperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an instance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that of CD-100 for the case studied here.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 27, "citationCount": 153, "influentialCitationCount": 10, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Physics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3468759", "name": "M.

For explanations of ML models in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, counterfactual examples are useful for an end-user only to the extent that perturbation of feature inputs is feasible in the real world. We formulate the problem of feasibility as preserving causal relationships among input features and present a method that uses (partial) structural causal models to generate actionable counterfactuals. When feasibility constraints cannot be easily expressed, we consider an alternative mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output.
