However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 241, "citationCount": 166, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3191461", "name": "Wouter M.

To choose the best algorithms for a specific task, users are advised to consider not only classification accuracy, but also comprehensibility, compactness, and robustness in training and classification. The purpose of this paper is to provide information to users so that they can choose the best algorithms for specific tasks. To alleviate the problem of obtaining enough training data, simulated training data were generated from single-date images. A one-pass classification with four machine learning algorithms, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Tree Classifiers (DTC), and the Maximum-Likelihood Classifier (MLC), were tested. Recognition rates, ease of use, and degree of automation of the four algorithms were assessed. The results showed that the incorporation of cross-combined simulated training data enhanced the detection of nature of change. Compared to conventional post-classification comparison methods, LVQ and DTC did better in terms of overall accuracy. In terms of average accuracy of the change classes, LVQ was the best performer.

Machine learning methods may excel at finding new features or nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as handling settings with more predictor variables than observations. However, the usefulness of both these data and machine learning has varied. Electronic health data often have quality issues (eg, missingness, misclassification, measurement error), and machine learning may perform similarly to standard techniques for some research questions. Ensembles (running multiple algorithms and either selecting the single best algorithm or creating a weighted average) can help mitigate the latter concern. Using several machine learning tools, Wong et al1 predicted delirium risk for newly hospitalized patients with high-dimensional electronic health record data at a large academic health institution. They compared these approaches with a questionnaire-based scoring system and found improved performance for machine learning with respect to several metrics calculated in a single holdout sample. Their article is a step toward updating delirium risk prediction. It also provides an opportunity to discuss 2 key issues in the current state of machine learning for prediction in electronic health data: evaluation and generalizability. The machine learning researchers who develop novel algorithms for prediction and the clinical teams interested in implementing them are frequently and unfortunately 2 nonintersecting groups. Thus, these algorithms may originally be built and evaluated in the machine learning literature based on metrics that are less clinically useful than other choices. Computer scientists and statisticians may optimize to achieve the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), but what a clinical team might need is high sensitivity or positive predictive value. Worse yet, algorithms can have misleading performance when evaluated only along 1 or 2 dimensions. For example, high AUC, accuracy, and positive predictive values can be accompanied by near-zero levels of sensitivity and specificity. It can also be essential to calculate metrics like the percentage of true cases in the top risk percentile.2 This is especially important when a goal of the tool is to target high-risk patients for interventions. Wong and colleagues1 helpfully compute AUC, positive predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. However, one accepted standard for evaluation that should be adopted in future clinical machine learning applications is K-fold cross-validation (eg, with K = 10) rather than the single holdout validation sample in their article. K-fold cross-validation involves K successive mutually exclusive validation sets where the algorithm fitting is iteratively performed on the nonvalidation data (ie, training set). At the end, each observation in the full data has a predicted value that was obtained from when it was part of a validation set. Typically, metrics calculated based on these K-fold cross-validated predicted values will more effectively assess overfitting and have lower variance.3 Of course, assessing the generalizability of a prediction algorithm goes well beyond using crossvalidated metrics to evaluate overfitting. Wong et al1 carefully discussed a number of limitations in their work, including the lack of external validation in other health systems. As in similar studies, the step from good performance in the study to a generalizable algorithm is vast and sometimes may not be feasible. Patients receiving treatment in varied care settings or geographic regions simply may require tailored tools. Recognizing the need for unique tools in different populations is not inherently negative, but one of many considerations not magically solved by using machine learning. Even those algorithms that prove to be generalizable may quickly become outdated as treatment patterns or physician incentives to code health conditions change.4 Increased social tolerance for certain + Related article", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount": 54, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48345067", "name": "Sherri Rose"}]}, {"paperId": "66fc1552c6fb6608c703baaf499686180593d80e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66fc1552c6fb6608c703baaf499686180593d80e", "title": "Compressed-Domain Ship Detection on Spaceborne Optical Image Using Deep Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machine", "abstract": "Ship detection on spaceborne images has attracted great interest in the applications of maritime security and traffic control. Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making.

This paper describes new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with little loss in accuracy.

To date, this issue has rarely been addressed in the land cover remote sensing literature. The authors present a method to estimate pixel-scale land cover classification confidence using nonparametric machine learning methods. The method is based on recent theoretical developments from the domains of statistics and machine learning that explain the machine learning technique known as \"boosting\" as being equivalent to additive logistic regression. As a result, results from classification algorithms that use boosting can be assigned classification confidences based on probability estimates assigned to them using this theory. they test this approach using three different data sets. Their results demonstrate that classification errors tend to have low classification confidence while correctly classified pixels tend to have higher confidence.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 18, "citationCount": 236, "influentialCitationCount": 27, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39483391", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2005216177", "name": "Zakhary Kaplan"}, {"authorId": "1714907", "name": "Di Niu"}, {"authorId": "91269142", "name": "Baochun Li"}]}, {"paperId": "a8156a77ec99bff4dbb914d9153600fb51e51fd0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8156a77ec99bff4dbb914d9153600fb51e51fd0", "title": "Support Vector Machines", "abstract": null, "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 71, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1680188", "name": "T.

These techniques are evaluated in a comprehensive suite of experiments, for which nearly four million classification models were trained. All classifiers are assessed using seven different performance metrics, providing a complete perspective on the performance of these techniques, and results are tested for statistical significance via analysis-of-variance modeling.

This Letter introduces the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks, where the data consist either of quantum states or of classical data, and the generator and discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the generator produces the same statistics as the data. Neither the generator nor the discriminator perform quantum tomography; linear programing drives them to the optimal. Since quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic, the proof of the quantum case is different from-and simpler than-the classical case.

Albeit its significant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move a significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of challenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output examples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their parse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is almost 0%. \nWe tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space. Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the model effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test accuracy on test inputs that are 500x longer than the training samples.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount": 42, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1425082935", "name": "Xinyun Chen"}, {"authorId": "2118484320", "name": "Chang Liu"}, {"authorId": "143711382", "name": "D.

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a \u201ccommittee\u201d of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model.

Then, the \u03b5-draggings are integrated into the LSR model for multiclass classification. Our learning framework, referred to as discriminative LSR, has a compact model form, where there is no need to train two-class machines that are independent of each other. With its compact form, this model can be naturally extended for feature selection. This goal is achieved in terms of L2,1 norm of matrix, generating a sparse learning model for feature selection.

One approach circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models before they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains.

Its accurate evaluation from first principles requires quantum chemistry methods that are often too demanding for routine use. The highly accurate calculations reported herein provide a much-needed benchmark of the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) as well as training data for a machine-learning model that can predict the polarizability tensor with an error that is about 50% smaller than DFT. This framework provides an accurate, inexpensive, and transferable strategy for estimating the polarizabilities of molecules containing dozens of atoms, and therefore removes a considerable obstacle to accurate and reliable atomistic-based modeling of matter. The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 95, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6287077", "name": "D.

The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance.

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real\u2010world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to\u2010date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here.

Products today are built with machine intelligence as a central attribute, and consumers are beginning to expect near-human interaction with the appliances they use. However, much of the deep learning revolution has been limited to the cloud. Recently, several machine learning packages based on edge devices have been announced which aim to offload the computing to the edges. However, little research has been done to evaluate these packages on the edges, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we make a performance comparison of several state-of-the-art machine learning packages on the edges, including TensorFlow, Caffe2, MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow Lite. We focus on evaluating the latency, memory footprint, and energy of these tools with two popular types of neural networks on different edge devices. This evaluation not only provides a reference to select appropriate combinations of hardware and software packages for end users but also points out possible future directions to optimize packages for developers.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 29, "citationCount": 67, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2153648026", "name": "Xingzhou Zhang"}, {"authorId": "2118420197", "name": "Yifan Wang"}, {"authorId": "38737155", "name": "Weisong Shi"}]}, {"paperId": "79a8674b05b045b459cf6eeba3b4687da1878fcd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79a8674b05b045b459cf6eeba3b4687da1878fcd", "title": "Risk-Aware Machine Learning Classifier for Skin Lesion Diagnosis", "abstract": "Knowing when a machine learning system is not confident about its prediction is crucial in medical domains where safety is critical.

In this paper, we investigate how Bayesian deep learning can improve the performance of the machine\u2013physician team in the skin lesion classification task. We used the publicly available HAM10000 dataset, which includes samples from seven common skin lesion categories: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic Nevi (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma (AKIEC), Benign Keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), and Vascular (VASC) lesions. Our experimental results show that Bayesian deep networks can boost the diagnostic performance of the standard DenseNet-169 model from 81.35% to 83.59% without incurring additional parameters or heavy computation. More importantly, a hybrid physician\u2013machine workflow reaches a classification accuracy of 90% while only referring 35% of the cases to physicians. The findings are expected to generalize to other medical diagnosis applications.

HSIs allow the characterization of objects of interest (e.g., land-cover classes) with unprecedented accuracy, and keeps inventories up to date. Improvements in spectral resolution have called for advances in signal processing and exploitation algorithms.
