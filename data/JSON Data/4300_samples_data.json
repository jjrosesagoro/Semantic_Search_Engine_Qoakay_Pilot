This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users\u2019 behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical tools, machine learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing, and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey relevant literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial on ML for researchers and practitioners interested in this field.

Secondly, it is also desirable that modification of control rules is possible in order to cope with previously unknown or changes in process dynamics.

Instead, new hope was put in the growing wake of machine learning that promised fully adaptive control algorithms which learn both by observation and trial-and-error. However, to date, learning techniques have yet to fulfill this promise as only few methods manage to scale into the high-dimensional domains of manipulator and humanoid robotics and usually scaling was only achieved in precisely pre-structured domains.

In this regard, unsupervised (e.g., K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)) and supervised (e.g., support vector machine (SVM) and weighted K-nearest-neighbor (KNN)) learning-based classification techniques are implemented for CSS. For a radio channel, the vector of the energy levels estimated at CR devices is treated as a feature vector and fed into a classifier to decide whether the channel is available or not. The classifier categorizes each feature vector into either of the two classes, namely, the \"channel available class\" and the \"channel unavailable class\". Prior to the online classification, the classifier needs to go through a training phase. For classification, the K-means clustering algorithm partitions the training feature vectors into K clusters, where each cluster corresponds to a combined state of primary users (PUs) and then the classifier determines the class the test energy vector belongs to. The GMM obtains a mixture of Gaussian density functions that well describes the training feature vectors. In the case of the SVM, the support vectors (i.e., a subset of training vectors which fully specify the decision function) are obtained by maximizing the margin between the separating hyperplane and the training feature vectors. Furthermore, the weighted KNN classification technique is proposed for CSS for which the weight of each feature vector is calculated by evaluating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of that feature vector. The performance of each classification technique is quantified in terms of the average training time, the sample classification delay, and the ROC curve.

A statistical learning machine tries to infer rules from a given set of examples such that it is able to make correct predictions on unseen examples. These predictions can for example be a classification or a regression. We consider the class of kernel based learning techniques. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. Building upon the theory of reproducing kernels we propose a number of new learning algorithms based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient in a kernel feature space. We exemplify this for oriented (kernel) PCA, and especially for Fisher\u2019s discriminant, yielding kernel Fisher discriminants (KFD). Furthermore, we show that KFD is intimately related to quadratic and linear optimization. Building upon this connection we propose several ways to deal with the optimization problems arising in kernel based methods and especially for KFD. This mathematical programming formulation is the starting point to derive several important and interesting variants of KFD, namely robust KFD, sparse KFD and linear KFD. Several algorithms to solve the resulting optimization problems are discussed. As a last consequence of the mathematical programming formulation we are able to relate KFD to other techniques like support vector machines, relevance vector machines and Arc-GV. Through a structural comparison of the underlying optimization problems we illustrate that many modern learning techniques, including KFD, are highly similar. In a separate chapter we present first results dealing with learning guarantees for eigenvalues and eigenvectors estimated from covariance matrices. We show that under some mild assumptions empirical eigenvalues are with high probability close to the expected eigenvalues when training on a specific, finite sample size. For eigenvectors we show that also with high probability an empirical eigenvector will be close to an eigenvector of the underlying distribution. In a large collection of experiments we demonstrate that KFD and its variants proposed here are capable of producing state of the art results.

In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision. Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery. Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada. In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets. InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively. The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs. Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 248, "influentialCitationCount": 19, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1961067", "name": "M.

However, this communication protocol can be adopted by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks for different nodes, which has been shown as a big threat to most machine learning models. Therefore, we in this article intend to study the model vulnerability of federated machine learning, and even on IoT systems. To be specific, we here attempt to attacking a popular federated multitask learning framework, which uses a general multitask learning framework to handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. The problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask learning is formulated as a bilevel program, which is adaptive to the arbitrary selection of target nodes and source attacking nodes. We then propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, called as attack on federated learning (AT2FL), to efficiently derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. This is an earlier work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via data poisoning. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both poisoning attacks.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "7332901", "name": "Gan Sun"}, {"authorId": "145702758", "name": "Yang Cong"}, {"authorId": "46436215", "name": "Jiahua Dong"}, {"authorId": "2153018830", "name": "Qiang Wang"}, {"authorId": "40478933", "name": "Ji Liu"}]}, {"paperId": "c3aecf64262314649008555b577a8e4b07d8046d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c3aecf64262314649008555b577a8e4b07d8046d", "title": "Machine learning and statistics: the interface", "abstract": "Statistical Properties of Tree-Based Approaches to Classification The Decision Tree Algorithm CAL5 Based on a Statistical Approach to its Splitting Algorithm Probabilistic Symbolic Classifiers: An Empirical Comparison from a Statistical Perspective A Multistrategy Approach to Learning Multiple Dependent Concepts Quality of Decision Rules - Definition and Classification Schemes for Multiple Rules DIPOL - A Hybrid Piecewise Linear Classifier Combining Classification Procedures Distance-based Decision Trees Learning Fuzzy Controllers from Examples Some Developments in Statistical Credit Scoring Combination of Statistical and Other Learning Methods to Predict Financial Time Series.", "year": 1996, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 77, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2444638", "name": "G.

This learning mechanism significantly challenges the attack from the server side. Although the state-of-the-art attacking techniques that incorporated the advance of Generative adversarial networks (GANs) could construct class representatives of the global data distribution among all clients, it is still challenging to distinguishably attack a specific client (i.e., user-level privacy leakage), which is a stronger privacy threat to precisely recover the private data from a specific client. This paper gives the first attempt to explore user-level privacy leakage against the federated learning by the attack from a malicious server. We propose a framework incorporating GAN with a multi-task discriminator, which simultaneously discriminates category, reality, and client identity of input samples. The novel discrimination on client identity enables the generator to recover user specified private data.

These methods are Integral of the Modulus of the Accelerometer (IMA) classification and a machine learning technique (MLT): support vector machine (SVM). These methods are then applied in a laboratory experiment to study their quality. A measurement setup is made to create a dataset of the following activities: standing, sitting, lying, walking (2.4 - 7.5 km/h) and cycling (10.1-19 km/h).

Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications.

Such predictive models are increasingly being applied to the mining of panels of genetic variants, environmental, or other nongenetic factors in the prediction of various complex traits and disease phenotypes [1]\u2013[8]. These studies are providing increasing evidence in support of the idea that machine learning provides a complementary view into the analysis of high-dimensional genetic datasets as compared to standard statistical association testing approaches. In contrast to identifying variants explaining most of the phenotypic variation at the population level, supervised machine learning models aim to maximize the predictive (or generalization) power at the level of individuals, hence providing exciting opportunities for e.g., individualized risk prediction based on personal genetic profiles [9]\u2013[11]. Machine learning models can also deal with genetic interactions, which are known to play an important role in the development and treatment of many complex diseases [12]\u2013[16], but are often missed by single-locus association tests [17]. Even in the absence of significant single-loci marginal effects, multilocus panels from distinct molecular pathways may provide synergistic contribution to the prediction power, thereby revealing part of such hidden heritability component that has remained missing because of too small marginal effects to pass the stringent genome-wide significance filters [18]. Multivariate modeling approaches have already been shown to provide improved insights into genetic mechanisms and the interaction networks behind many complex traits, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and lipid levels, which would have gone undetected using the standard univariate modeling [2], [19]\u2013[22]. However, machine learning models also come with inherent pitfalls, such as increased computational complexity and the risk for model overfitting, which must be understood in order to avoid reporting unrealistic prediction models or over-optimistic prediction results. \n \nWe argue here that many medical applications of machine learning models in genetic disease risk prediction rely essentially on two factors: effective model regularization and rigorous model validation. We demonstrate the effects of these factors using representative examples from the literature as well as illustrative case examples. This review is not meant to be a comprehensive survey of all predictive modeling approaches, but we focus on regularized machine learning models, which enforces constraints on the complexity of the learned models so that they would ignore irrelevant patterns in the training examples. Simple risk allele counting or other multilocus risk models that do not incorporate any model parameters to be learned are outside the scope of this review; in fact, such simplistic models that assume independent variants may lead to suboptimal prediction performance in the presence of either direct or indirect interactions through epistasis effects or linkage disequilibrium, respectively [23], [24]. Perhaps the simplest models considered here as learning approaches are those based on weighted risk allele summaries [23], [25]. However, even with such basic risk models intended for predictive purposes, it is important to learn the model parameters (e.g., select the variants and determine their weights) based on training data only; otherwise there is a severe risk of model overfitting, i.e., models not being capable of generalizing to new samples [5]. Representative examples of how model learning and regularization approaches address the overfitting problem are briefly summarized in Box 1, while those readers interested in their implementation details are referred to the accompanying Text S1. We specifically promote here the use of such regularized machine learning models that are scalable to the entire genome-wide scale, often based on linear models, which are easy to interpret and also enable straightforward variable selection. Genome-scale approaches avoid the need of relying on two-stage approaches [26], which apply standard statistical procedures to reduce the number of variants, since such prefiltering may miss predictive interactions across loci and therefore lead to reduced predictive performance [8], [24], [25], [27], [28]. \n \n \nBox 1. Synthesis of Learning Models for Genetic Risk Prediction \nThe aim of risk models is to capture in a mathematical form the patterns in the genetic and non-genetic data most important for the prediction of disease susceptibility. The first step in model building involves choosing the functional form of the model (e.g., linear or nonlinear), and then making use of a given training data to determine the adjustable parameters of the model (e.g., a subset of variants, their weights, and other model parameters). While it is often sufficient for a statistical model to enable high enough explanatory power in the discovery material, without being overly complicated, a predictive model is also required to generalize to unseen cases. \n \nOne consideration in the model construction is how to encode the genotypic measurements using genotype models, such as the dominant, recessive, multiplicative, or additive model, each implying different assumptions about the genetic effects in the data [79]. Categorical variables 0, 1, and 2 are typically used for treating genetic predictor variables (e.g., minor allele dosage), while numeric values are required for continuous risk factors (e.g., blood pressure). Expected posterior probabilities of the genotypes can also be used, especially for imputed genotypes. Transforming the genotype categories into three binary features is an alternative way to deal with missing values without imputation (used in the T1D example; see Text S1 for details). \n \n \nStatistical or machine learning models identify statistical or predictive interactions, respectively, rather than biological interactions between or within variants [12], [80]. While nonlinear models may better capture complex genetic interactions [7], [81], linear models are easier to interpret and provide a scalable option for performing supervised selection of multilocus variant panels at the genome-wide scale [3]. In linear models, genetic interactions are modeled implicitly by selecting such variant combinations that together are predictive of the phenotype, rather than considering pairwise gene\u2013gene relationships explicitly. Formally, trait yi to be predicted for an individual i is modeled as a linear combination of the individual's predictor variables xij: \n \n \n \n \n(1) \n \n \nHere, the weights wj are assumed constant across the n individuals, w 0 is the bias offset term and p indicates the number of predictors discovered in the training data. In its basic form, Eq. 1 can be used for modeling continuous traits y (linear regression). For case-control classification, the binary dependent variable y is often transformed using a logistic loss function, which models the probability of a case class given a genotype profile and other risk factor covariates x (logistic regression). It has been shown that the logistic regression and naive Bayes risk models are mathematically very closely related in the context of genetic risk prediction [81].", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 124, "citationCount": 114, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2013961", "name": "S.

In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as \u2018virtual screening\u2019 (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and benchmarking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions.

However, the major challenge in these methods is obtaining real-time and unbiased datasets.

While such focus on in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles), resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations than to define and quantify bias.

Such an iterative process could cause privacy concerns of data owners. The goal of this paper is to provide differential privacy for ADMM-based distributed machine learning. Prior approaches on differentially private ADMM exhibit low utility under high privacy guarantee and assume the objective functions of the learning problems to be smooth and strongly convex. To address these concerns, we propose a novel differentially private ADMM-based distributed learning algorithm called DP-ADMM, which combines an approximate augmented Lagrangian function with time-varying Gaussian noise addition in the iterative process to achieve higher utility for general objective functions under the same differential privacy guarantee. We also apply the moments accountant method to analyze the end-to-end privacy loss.

We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather.

Although the convergence of CCCP can be derived from the convergence of the d.c. algorithm (DCA), its proof is more specialized and technical than actually required for the specific case of CCCP. In this paper, we follow a different reasoning and show how Zangwill's global convergence theory of iterative algorithms provides a natural framework to prove the convergence of CCCP, allowing a more elegant and simple proof. This underlines Zangwill's theory as a powerful and general framework to deal with the convergence issues of iterative algorithms, after also being used to prove the convergence of algorithms like expectation-maximization, generalized alternating minimization, etc. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence of CCCP by addressing these questions: (i) When does CCCP find a local minimum or a stationary point of the d.c. program under consideration?

Machine-learning may offer potential to explore outcomes of even greater complexity, such as premature death. This study aimed to develop novel prediction algorithms using machine-learning, in addition to standard survival modelling, to predict premature all-cause mortality. Methods A prospective population cohort of 502,628 participants aged 40\u201369 years were recruited to the UK Biobank from 2006\u20132010 and followed-up until 2016. Participants were assessed on a range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle factors. Mortality data by ICD-10 were obtained from linkage to Office of National Statistics. Models were developed using deep learning, random forest and Cox regression. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed to predicted risks; and discrimination by area under the \u2018receiver operating curve\u2019 (AUC). Findings 14,418 deaths (2.9%) occurred over a total follow-up time of 3,508,454 person-years. A simple age and gender Cox model was the least predictive (AUC 0.689, 95% CI 0.681\u20130.699). A multivariate Cox regression model significantly improved discrimination by 6.2% (AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.748\u20130.767). The application of machine-learning algorithms further improved discrimination by 3.2% using random forest (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.776\u20130.791) and 3.9% using deep learning (AUC 0.790, 95% CI 0.783\u20130.797). These ML algorithms improved discrimination by 9.4% and 10.1% respectively from a simple age and gender Cox regression model. Random forest and deep learning achieved similar levels of discrimination with no significant difference. Machine-learning algorithms were well-calibrated, while Cox regression models consistently over-predicted risk.
