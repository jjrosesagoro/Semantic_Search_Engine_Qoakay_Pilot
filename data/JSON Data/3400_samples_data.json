However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior -- often referred to as gaming -- the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming. We model classification as a sequential game between a player named \"Jury\" and a player named \"Contestant.\" Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier drawn from a distribution. Before being classified, Contestant may change his input based on Jury's classifier. However, Contestant incurs a cost for these changes according to a cost function. Jury's goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's original input and some underlying target classification function, assuming Contestant plays best response. Contestant's goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account the cost of achieving it. For a natural class of \"separable\" cost functions, and certain generalizations, we obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms which are near optimal, achieving a classification error that is arbitrarily close to the theoretical minimum. Surprisingly, our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn.

We present expert-augmented machine learning, an automated way to automatically extract problem-specific human expert knowledge and integrate it with machine learning to build robust, dependable, and data-efficient predictive models.

Using an online platform, we asked 15 clinicians to assess the relative risk of the subpopulation defined by each rule compared to the total sample. We compared the clinician-assessed risk to the empirical risk and found that, while clinicians agreed with the data in most cases, there were notable exceptions where they overestimated or underestimated the true risk. Studying the rules with greatest disagreement, we identified problems with the training data, including one miscoded variable and one hidden confounder. Filtering the rules based on the extent of disagreement between clinician-assessed risk and empirical risk, we improved performance on out-of-sample data and were able to train with less data.

The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest.

However, these learned states become unstable as longer and longer test input strings are presented to the network. In essence, the network forgets where the individual states are in activation space. In this paper we propose a new method to force such a network to learn stable states by introducing discretization into the network and using a pseudo-gradient learning rule to perform training. The essence of the learning rule is that in doing gradient descent, it makes use of the gradient of a sigmoid function as a heuristic hint in place of that of the hard-limiting function, while still using the discretized value in the feedback update path. The new structure uses isolated points in activation space instead of vague clusters as its internal representation of states. It is shown to have similar capabilities in learning finite state automata as the original network, but without the instability problem. The proposed pseudo-gradient learning rule may also be used as a basis for training other types of networks that have hard-limiting threshold activation functions.", "year": 1993, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount": 147, "influentialCitationCount": 16, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2075413715", "name": "Zheng Zeng"}, {"authorId": "145135018", "name": "R.

This exposes learning algorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which a fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated to subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only against a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent complexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning points (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we first extend the definition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel poisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to compute the gradient of interest through automatic differentiation, while also reversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity. Compared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a wider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient-based procedures, including neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically evaluate its effectiveness on several application examples, including spam filtering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition.

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems.

Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coffiecients, average treatment e ffects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimators of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly. For example, the resulting estimators may formally have inferior rates of convergence with respect to the sample size n caused by regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Speci ficially, we can form an efficient score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The efficient score may then be used to build an efficient estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/v n rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, allowing simple construction of valid con fidence intervals for parameters of interest. The resulting method thus could be called a \"double ML\" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. Such double ML estimators achieve the fastest rates of convergence and exhibit robust good behavior with respect to a broader class of probability distributions than naive \"single\" ML estimators. In order to avoid overfi tting, following [3], our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross- fitting. The use of sample splitting allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregates of these methods (e.g. a hybrid of a random forest and lasso). We illustrate the application of the general theory through application to the leading cases of estimation and inference on the main parameter in a partially linear regression model and estimation and inference on average treatment eff ects and average treatment e ffects on the treated under conditional random assignment of the treatment. These applications cover randomized control trials as a special case. We then use the methods in an empirical application which estimates the e ffect of 401(k) eligibility on accumulated financial assets.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 161, "influentialCitationCount": 24, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "26331346", "name": "V.

To address these problems, this paper describes an efficient solution based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model, called active online-weighted ELM (AOW-ELM). The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the reasons why active learning can be disrupted by an imbalanced instance distribution and its influencing factors are discussed in detail; 2) the hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to select initially labeled instances in order to avoid the missed cluster effect and cold start phenomenon as much as possible; 3) the weighted ELM (WELM) is selected as the base classifier to guarantee the impartiality of instance selection in the procedure of active learning, and an efficient online updated mode of WELM is deduced in theory; and 4) an early stopping criterion that is similar to but more flexible than the margin exhaustion criterion is presented.

Here we develop a machine learning protocol for the prediction of DNA-BPs where the classifier is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Information used for classification is derived from characteristics that include surface and overall composition, overall charge and positive potential patches on the protein surface. In total 121 DNA-BPs and 238 non-binding proteins are used to build and evaluate the protocol. In self-consistency, accuracy value of 100% has been achieved. For cross-validation (CV) optimization over entire dataset, we report an accuracy of 90%. Using leave 1-pair holdout evaluation, the accuracy of 86.3% has been achieved. When we restrict the dataset to less than 20% sequence identity amongst the proteins, the holdout accuracy is achieved at 85.8%. Furthermore, seven DNA-BPs with unbounded structures are all correctly predicted. The current performances are better than results published previously. The higher accuracy value achieved here originates from two factors: the ability of the SVM to handle features that demonstrate a wide range of discriminatory power and, a different definition of the positive patch.

On the basis of these observations, the authors developed a new method for the prediction of protein\u2013protein interaction sites, using machine learning approaches to combine the most informative features into the final predictor. For training and validation, the authors used several large sets of protein complexes and derived from them nonredundant representative chains, with interaction sites mapped from multiple complexes. Alternative machine learning techniques are used, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, so as to evaluate the relative effects of the choice of a representation and a specific learning algorithm. The effects of induced fit and uncertainty of the negative (noninteracting) class assignment are also evaluated. Several representative methods from the literature are reimplemented to enable direct comparison of the results. Using rigorous validation protocols, the authors estimated that the new method yields the overall classification accuracy of about 74% and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.42, as opposed to up to 70% classification accuracy and up to 0.3 Matthews correlation coefficient for methods that do not utilize RSA prediction\u2010based fingerprints.

While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to push forward the interface between these two important subfields, which have been largely treated as isolated in the community.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 89, "citationCount": 142, "influentialCitationCount": 13, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145254043", "name": "Jun Zhu"}, {"authorId": "1406245631", "name": "Ning Chen"}, {"authorId": "143977260", "name": "E.

In this paper, a novel and effective geospatial object detection framework is proposed by combining the weakly supervised learning (WSL) and high-level feature learning. First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning.
