Toward that goal, the authors propose a novel representation for the recognition of protein\u2013protein interaction sites that integrates enhanced relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predictions with high resolution structural data. An observation that RSA predictions are biased toward the level of surface exposure consistent with protein complexes led the authors to investigate the difference between the predicted and actual (i.e., observed in an unbound structure) RSA of an amino acid residue as a fingerprint of interaction sites. The authors demonstrate that RSA prediction\u2010based fingerprints of protein interactions significantly improve the discrimination between interacting and noninteracting sites, compared with evolutionary conservation, physicochemical characteristics, structure\u2010derived and other features considered before. On the basis of these observations, the authors developed a new method for the prediction of protein\u2013protein interaction sites, using machine learning approaches to combine the most informative features into the final predictor. For training and validation, the authors used several large sets of protein complexes and derived from them nonredundant representative chains, with interaction sites mapped from multiple complexes. Alternative machine learning techniques are used, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, so as to evaluate the relative effects of the choice of a representation and a specific learning algorithm. The effects of induced fit and uncertainty of the negative (noninteracting) class assignment are also evaluated. Several representative methods from the literature are reimplemented to enable direct comparison of the results. Using rigorous validation protocols, the authors estimated that the new method yields the overall classification accuracy of about 74% and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.42, as opposed to up to 70% classification accuracy and up to 0.3 Matthews correlation coefficient for methods that do not utilize RSA prediction\u2010based fingerprints.

While priors can affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain graph models. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics.

Linear combinations of different models were tested as well as bagging and boosting methods, but they did not improve accuracy.

In the development of CDRs, limitations in analytic methods and concerns with usability have generally constrained models to a preselected small set of variables judged to be clinically relevant and to rules that are easily calculated. Furthermore, CDRs frequently suffer from questions of generalizability, take years to develop, and lack the ability to be updated as new information becomes available. Newer analytic and machine learning techniques capable of harnessing the large number of variables that are already available through electronic health records (EHRs) may better predict patient outcomes and facilitate automation and deployment within clinical decision support systems. In this proof-of-concept study, a local, big data-driven, machine learning approach is compared to existing CDRs and traditional analytic methods using the prediction of sepsis in-hospital mortality as the use case.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a retrospective study of adult ED visits admitted to the hospital meeting criteria for sepsis from October 2013 to October 2014. Sepsis was defined as meeting criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome with an infectious admitting diagnosis in the ED. ED visits were randomly partitioned into an 80%/20% split for training and validation. A random forest model (machine learning approach) was constructed using over 500 clinical variables from data available within the EHRs of four hospitals to predict in-hospital mortality. The machine learning prediction model was then compared to a classification and regression tree (CART) model, logistic regression model, and previously developed prediction tools on the validation data set using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and chi-square statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 5,278 visits among 4,676 unique patients who met criteria for sepsis. Of the 4,222 patients in the training group, 210 (5.0%) died during hospitalization, and of the 1,056 patients in the validation group, 50 (4.7%) died during hospitalization. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models were as follows: random forest model, 0.86 (95% CI = 0.82 to 0.90); CART model, 0.69 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.77); logistic regression model, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.69 to 0.82); CURB-65, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.80); MEDS, 0.71 (95% CI = 0.63 to 0.77); and mREMS, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.79). The random forest model AUC was statistically different from all other models (p \u2264 0.003 for all comparisons).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this proof-of-concept study, a local big data-driven, machine learning approach outperformed existing CDRs as well as traditional analytic techniques for predicting in-hospital mortality of ED patients with sepsis. Future research should prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and whether it translates into improved clinical outcomes for high-risk sepsis patients. The methods developed serve as an example of a new model for predictive analytics in emergency care that can be automated, applied to other clinical outcomes of interest, and deployed in EHRs to enable locally relevant clinical predictions.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 61, "citationCount": 301, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2107598798", "name": "R.

We introduce generic notions of complexity for the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves information-theoretic quantities and holds when m \u2265 1 under general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive refined lower bounds in both the fixedcon fidence and fixed-budget settings, along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times.

This paper explores the use of machine-learning based alternatives to standard statistical data completion (data imputation) methods, for dealing with missing data. We have approached the data completion problem using two well-known machine learning techniques. The first is an unsupervised clustering strategy which uses a Bayesian approach to cluster the data into classes. The classes so obtained are then used to predict multiple choices for the attribute of interest. The second technique involves modeling missing variables by supervised induction of a decision tree-based classifier. This predicts the most likely value for the attribute of interest. Empirical tests using extracts from industrial databases maintained by Honeywell customers have been done in order to compare the two techniques. These tests show both approaches are useful and have advantages and disadvantages.

Kernel methods form an important class of techniques that induce a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for inferring non-linear models through the construction of similarity functions from data. These methods are particularly preferred in cases where the training data sizes are limited and when prior knowledge of the data similarities is available. Despite their usefulness, they are limited by the computational complexity and their inability to support end-to-end learning with a task-specific objective. On the other hand, deep neural networks have become the de facto solution for end-to-end inference in several learning paradigms. In this paper, we explore the idea of using deep architectures to perform kernel machine optimization, for both computational efficiency and end-to-end inferencing. To this end, we develop the deep kernel machine optimization framework, that creates an ensemble of dense embeddings using Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximations and utilizes deep learning to generate task-specific representations through the fusion of the embeddings. Intuitively, the filters of the network are trained to fuse information from an ensemble of linear subspaces in the RKHS. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel dropout regularization to enable improved training convergence. Finally, we extend this framework to the multiple kernel case, by coupling a global fusion layer with pretrained deep kernel machines for each of the constituent kernels. Using case studies with limited training data, and lack of explicit feature sources, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over conventional model inferencing techniques.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 71, "citationCount": 42, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "72482217", "name": "Huan Song"}, {"authorId": "121241127", "name": "Jayaraman J.

Traditional machine learning solutions assume the existence of (cloud-based) central entities that are in charge of processing the data. Nonetheless, the difficulty of accessing private data, together with the high cost of transmitting raw data to the central entity gave rise to a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. The main idea of federated learning is to perform an on-device collaborative training of a single machine learning model without having to share the raw training data with any third-party entity. Although few survey articles on federated learning already exist in the literature, the motivation of this survey stems from three essential observations. The first one is the lack of a fine-grained multi-level classification of the federated learning literature, where the existing surveys base their classification on only one criterion or aspect. The second observation is that the existing surveys focus only on some common challenges, but disregard other essential aspects such as reliable client selection, resource management and training service pricing. The third observation is the lack of explicit and straightforward directives for researchers to help them design future federated learning solutions that overcome the state-of-the-art research gaps. To address these points, we first provide a comprehensive tutorial on federated learning and its associated concepts, technologies and learning approaches. We then survey and highlight the applications and future directions of federated learning in the domain of communication and networking. Thereafter, we design a three-level classification scheme that first categorizes the federated learning literature based on the high-level challenge that they tackle. Then, we classify each high-level challenge into a set of specific low-level challenges to foster a better understanding of the topic. Finally, we provide, within each low-level challenge, a fine-grained classification based on the technique used to address this particular challenge. For each category of high-level challenges, we provide a set of desirable criteria and future research directions that are aimed to help the research community design innovative and efficient future solutions.

Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. We pay particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction Daume III et al. [2009]. To structure this discussion, we categorize imitation learning techniques based on the following key criteria which drive algorithmic decisions: \n \n1) The structure of the policy space. Is the learned policy a time-index trajectory (trajectory learning), a mapping from observations to actions (so called behavioral cloning [Bain and Sammut, 1996]), or the result of a complex optimization or planning problem at each execution as is common in inverse optimal control methods [Kalman, 1964, Moylan and Anderson, 1973]. \n \n2) The information available during training and testing. In particular, is the learning algorithm privy to the full state that the teacher possess? Is the learner able to interact with the teacher and gather corrections or more data? Does the learner have a (typically a priori) model of the system with which it interacts? Does the learner have access to the reward (cost) function that the teacher is attempting to optimize? \n \n3) The notion of success. Different algorithmic approaches provide varying guarantees on the resulting learned behavior. These guarantees range from weaker (e.g., measuring disagreement with the agent\u2019s decision) to stronger (e.g., providing guarantees on the performance of the learner with respect to a true cost function, either known or unknown). We organize our work by paying particular attention to distinction (1): dividing imitation learning into directly replicating desired behavior (sometimes called behavioral cloning) and learning the hidden objectives of the desired behavior from demonstrations (called inverse optimal control or inverse reinforcement learning [Russell, 1998]). In the latter case, behavior arises as the result of an optimization problem solved for each new instance that the learner faces. In addition to method analysis, we discuss the design decisions a practitioner must make when selecting an imitation learning approach. Moreover, application examples\u2014such as robots that play table tennis [Kober and Peters, 2009], programs that play the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016], and systems that understand natural language [Wen et al., 2015]\u2014 illustrate the properties and motivations behind different forms of imitation learning.

Despite the growing number of students using MT, little is known about its use as a pedagogical tool in the EFL classroom. The present study investigated the role of MT as a CALL tool in EFL writing. Most studies on MT as a tool for L2 learning have focused on student postediting of the translation that MT provides; however, the present study employed a different design with students translating their L1 writing into L2 without the help of MT and then correcting their L2 writing using the MT translation for comparison. Text analysis of students\u2019 writing outcomes revealed that MT helped to decrease lexico-grammatical errors and improve student revisions. Using MT for revisions also positively affected student writing strategies and helped them think of writing as a process. The interviews and reflection papers demonstrated that students viewed the use of MT during writing positively. This study found that MT can be a useful aid to language learning, but for it to benefit student learning, teachers must be aware of its limitations and provide adequate guidance to students.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount": 74, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3428747", "name": "Sangmin-Michelle Lee"}]}, {"paperId": "c985afab132dae139ea7fe648bf4ef19b4026a1c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c985afab132dae139ea7fe648bf4ef19b4026a1c", "title": "A probabilistic active support vector learning algorithm", "abstract": "The paper describes a probabilistic active learning strategy for support vector machine (SVM) design in large data applications.

Introduction.-This note introduces some nonlinear difference-differential equations which can be interpreted as a learning theory or, alternatively, as a prediction theory whose goal is to discuss the prediction of individual events, in a fixed order, and at prescribed times. The theory provides a mathematical description of the following kind of experiment. An experimenter g, confronted by a machine MlZ, presents M with a list of \"letters\" or \"events\" to be learned. Suppose, for example, that g wishes to teach 9Mt the list of letters AB, or to predict the event B, given the event A. g does this by presenting A and then B to M several times. To find out if SE has learned the list as a result of these list presentations, the letter A alone is then presented to M. If M responds with the letter B, and M does this whenever A alone is said, then we have good evidence that MR has indeed learned the list AB. Thus M learns to predict the event B whenever the event A occurs as a result of repeated presentations of the list AB. We will introduce some mathematical machines that learn lists in the above manner. These machines have some properties that have a familiar intuitive interpretation. For example, in our simplest machine, it is possible to make rigorous the heuristic statements that (1) \"practice makes perfect,\" (2) an isolated system suffers no memory loss, (3) an isolated system remembers without practicing overtly, (4) the memory of an isolated system sometimes spontaneously improves without practice, (5) all errors can be corrected, although the rate of correction is sometimes diminished by response interference due to prior learning, (6) increasing the number of response alternatives sometimes diminishes the learning rate, and so on. All of the machines we will introduce possess the same dynamical laws. Nonetheless , the exact manner in which a given machine learns and remembers depends crucially on the particular way in which the components of the machine are interconnected ; i.e., on its \"geometry.\" For example, properties (2) and (3) above do not hold in all the machines we shall describe. In this note, we will sketch some results for our simplest machine. These results, along with results for more complicated machines, are described in greater detail in another place.' 2.

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on part of the data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and the validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular CV methods: record-wise and subject-wise. While the subject-wise method mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosis in newly recruited subjects, the record-wise strategy has no such interpretation. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise CV often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method was used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes.

Traditionally, various statistical methods were used for modeling crash injury severities. In recent years, machine learning-based methods are becoming popular due to their good predictive performance. However, the machine learning-based models are usually criticized as they perform like a black-box. In this paper, we aim at comparing the predictive performance, including prediction accuracy and estimation of variable importance, among various machine learning and statistical methods with distinct modeling logic for crash severity analysis. The crash severity, road geometry, and traffic flow data were collected at freeway diverge areas in Florida. We estimated two most commonly used statistical methods which were ordered probit (OP) model and multinomial logit model, and four popular machine learning methods, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine. The correct prediction rate for each crash severity level and the overall correct prediction rate were calculated.

The performance of each regressor/representation/property combination is assessed using learning curves which report out-of-sample errors as a function of training set size with up to \u223c118k distinct molecules. Molecular structures and properties at the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) level of theory come from the QM9 database [ Ramakrishnan et al. Sci. Data 2014 , 1 , 140022 ] and include enthalpies and free energies of atomization, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, dipole moment, polarizability, zero point vibrational energy, heat capacity, and the highest fundamental vibrational frequency. Various molecular representations have been studied (Coulomb matrix, bag of bonds, BAML and ECFP4, molecular graphs (MG)), as well as newly developed distribution based variants including histograms of distances (HD), angles (HDA/MARAD), and dihedrals (HDAD). Regressors include linear models (Bayesian ridge regression (BR) and linear regression with elastic net regularization (EN)), random forest (RF), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and two types of neural networks, graph convolutions (GC) and gated graph networks (GG). Out-of sample errors are strongly dependent on the choice of representation and regressor and molecular property. Electronic properties are typically best accounted for by MG and GC, while energetic properties are better described by HDAD and KRR. The specific combinations with the lowest out-of-sample errors in the \u223c118k training set size limit are (free) energies and enthalpies of atomization (HDAD/KRR), HOMO/LUMO eigenvalue and gap (MG/GC), dipole moment (MG/GC), static polarizability (MG/GG), zero point vibrational energy (HDAD/KRR), heat capacity at room temperature (HDAD/KRR), and highest fundamental vibrational frequency (BAML/RF). We present numerical evidence that ML model predictions deviate from DFT (B3LYP) less than DFT (B3LYP) deviates from experiment for all properties.
