Unlike English as a Second Language ( ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3 D virtual world, Open Simulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts ( VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot ( VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine ( VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine ( VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.

The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioral observation of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10) and may be prone to misdiagnosis. In order to move the field toward more quantitative diagnosis, we need advanced and scalable machine learning infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental health disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for classifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a single layer perceptron (SLP) which results in improved quality of extracted features and optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a data augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature vectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset provided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1, 035 subjects coming from 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms other state of the art methods from 10 imaging centers with increase in classification accuracy up to 28% with maximum accuracy of 82%. The machine learning technique presented in this paper, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous advantages in terms of execution time (40 min vs. 7 h on other methods).

These schemes are of importance in long-distance quantum communication, and their discovery has shaped the field of quantum information processing. However, the usefulness of learning agents goes beyond the mere re-production of known protocols; the same approach allows one to find improved solutions to long-distance communication problems, in particular when dealing with asymmetric situations where channel noise and segment distance are non-uniform. Our findings are based on the use of projective simulation, a model of a learning agent that combines reinforcement learning and decision making in a physically motivated framework. The learning agent is provided with a universal gate set, and the desired task is specified via a reward scheme. From a technical perspective, the learning agent has to deal with stochastic environments and reactions.

We studied whether human observers can reliably judge engagement from the face; analyzed the signals observers use to make these judgments; and automated the process using machine learning. We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's \u03ba = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high ( \u03ba = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r=0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers. We used machine learning to develop automatic engagement detectors and found that for binary classification (e.g., high engagement versus low engagement), automated engagement detectors perform with comparable accuracy to humans. Finally, we show that both human and automatic engagement judgments correlate with task performance.

However, it remains an outstanding task because of the great challenges in effective spatial-temporal feature extraction and efficient classification with high-dimensional video representations. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework called deep ensemble machine (DEM) for video classification. Specifically, to establish effective spatio-temporal features, we propose using two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), i.e., vision and graphics group and C3-D to extract heterogeneous spatial and temporal features for complementary representations. To achieve efficient classification, we propose ensemble learning based on random projections aiming to transform high-dimensional features into a set of lower dimensional compact features in subspaces; an ensemble of classifiers is trained on the subspaces and combined with a weighting layer during the backpropagation. To further enhance the performance, we introduce rectified linear encoding (RLE) inspired from error-correcting output coding to encode the initial outputs of classifiers, followed by a softmax layer to produce the final classification results. DEM combines the strengths of deep CNNs and ensemble learning, which establishes a new end-to-end learning architecture for more accurate and efficient video classification.

Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 46, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "24593911", "name": "Tri Dao"}, {"authorId": "39499001", "name": "Albert Gu"}, {"authorId": "41022841", "name": "Matthew Eichhorn"}, {"authorId": "1755572", "name": "A.

These inputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected perturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired misclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific to the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be conveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual appearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more security-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose significant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for failure. \nIn this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample crafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The application domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints in the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision domain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete, often binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance unchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of malware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set. We furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against adversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification. While feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation and re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 343, "influentialCitationCount": 27, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39221858", "name": "Kathrin Grosse"}, {"authorId": "1967156", "name": "Nicolas Papernot"}, {"authorId": "2134700604", "name": "Praveen Manoharan"}, {"authorId": "144588806", "name": "M.

The resulting data is \"born\" geographically distributed. On the other hand, many machine learning applications require a global view of such data in order to achieve the best results. These types of applications form a new class of learning problems, which we call Geo-Distributed Machine Learning (GDML). Such applications need to cope with: 1) scarce and expensive cross-data center bandwidth, and 2) growing privacy concerns that are pushing for stricter data sovereignty regulations. Current solutions to learning from geo-distributed data sources revolve around the idea of first centralizing the data in one data center, and then training locally. As machine learning algorithms are communication-intensive, the cost of centralizing the data is thought to be offset by the lower cost of intra-data center communication during training. In this work, we show that the current centralized practice can be far from optimal, and propose a system for doing geo-distributed training. Furthermore, we argue that the geo-distributed approach is structurally more amenable to dealing with regulatory constraints, as raw data never leaves the source data center.

Chronic kidney disease involves conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy.

Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. Data Mining is the term used for knowledge discovery from large databases. The task of data mining is to make use of historical data, to discover regular patterns and improve future decisions, follows from the convergence of several recent trends: the lessening cost of large data storage devices and the everincreasing ease of collecting data over networks; the expansion of robust and efficient machine learning algorithms to process this data; and the lessening cost of computational power, enabling use of computationally intensive methods for data analysis. Machine learning, has already created practical applications in such areas as analyzing medical science outcomes, detecting fraud, detecting fake users etc. Various data mining classification approaches and machine learning algorithms are applied for prediction of chronic diseases. The objective of this research work is to introduce a new decision support system to predict chronic kidney disease. The aim of this work is to compare the performance of Support vector machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier on the basis of its accuracy, precision and execution time for CKD prediction.

In addition, the design choices of parameterization, prior distribution, hard versus soft EM and online versus offline assignment can dramatically affect model performance. We develop an evaluation protocol to assess both quality and diversity of generations against multiple references, and provide an extensive empirical study of several mixture model variants.

To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points. First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a $ k$ -means clustering method.

Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data.

Unlike conventional machine learning situations, data flow targeted by incremental learning becomes available continuously over time. Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to abandon the traditional assumption of the availability of representative training data during the training period to develop decision boundaries. Under scenarios of continuous data flow, the challenge is how to transform the vast amount of stream raw data into information and knowledge representation, and accumulate experience over time to support future decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a general adaptive incremental learning framework named ADAIN that is capable of learning from continuous raw data, accumulating experience over time, and using such knowledge to improve future learning and prediction performance.

In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar\u2019s chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 \u00b1 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 \u00b1 0.017), random forests (0.739 \u00b1 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 \u00b1 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar\u2019s test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified.

Methods We employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review. Results Three hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering. Conclusions Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health.

The risk factor and severity of diabetes can be reduced significantly if the precise early prediction is possible. The robust and accurate prediction of diabetes is highly challenging due to the limited number of labeled data and also the presence of outliers (or missing values) in the diabetes datasets. In this literature, we are proposing a robust framework for diabetes prediction where the outlier rejection, filling the missing values, data standardization, feature selection, K-fold cross-validation, and different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (k-nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were employed. The weighted ensembling of different ML models is also proposed, in this literature, to improve the prediction of diabetes where the weights are estimated from the corresponding Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of the ML model. AUC is chosen as the performance metric, which is then maximized during hyperparameter tuning using the grid search technique. All the experiments, in this literature, were conducted under the same experimental conditions using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset.

Data mining and machine learning techniques have been used increasingly in the analysis of data in various fields ranging from medicine to finance, education and energy applications. Machine learning techniques make it possible to deduct meaningful further information from those data processed by data mining. Such meaningful and significant information helps organizations to establish their future policies on a sounder basis, and to gain major advantages in terms of time and cost. This study applies classification algorithms used in data mining and machine learning techniques on those data obtained from individuals during the vocational guidance process, and tries to determine the most appropriate algorithm.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 29, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144309530", "name": "H.
