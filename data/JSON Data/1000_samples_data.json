A large body of recent literature has focussed on the transductive setting where labels of unlabeled examples are estimated by learning a function defined only over the point cloud data. In a truly semi-supervised setting however, a learning machine has access to labeled and unlabeled examples and must make predictions on data points never encountered before. In this paper, we show how to turn transductive and standard supervised learning algorithms into semi-supervised learners. We construct a family of data-dependent norms on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). These norms allow us to warp the structure of the RKHS to reflect the underlying geometry of the data. We derive explicit formulas for the corresponding new kernels.

To develop such a technique, it was necessary to rst extract factors responsible for future generalization, to obtain bounds on generalization that depend on these factors, and lastly to develop a technique that constructively minimizes these bounds. The subject of this book are methods based on combining advanced branches of statistics and functional analysis, developing these theories into practical algorithms that perform better than existing heuristic approaches. The book provides a comprehensive analysis of what can be done using Support Vector Machines, achieving record results in real-life pattern recognition problems. In addition, it proposes a new form of nonlinear Principal Component Analysis using Support Vector kernel techniques, which I consider as the most natural and elegant way for generalization of classical Principal Component Analysis. In many ways the Support Vector machine became so popular thanks to works of Bernhard Schh olkopf. The work, submitted for the title of Doktor der Naturwis-senschaften, appears as excellent.

Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process.

Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration.

Statistical Learning Theory or SLT is a small sample statistics by Vapnik \ue006et al.,\ue006 which concerns mainly the statistic principles when samples are limited, especially the properties of learning procedure in such cases. SLT provides us a new framework for the general learning problem, and a novel powerful learning method called Support Vector Machine or SVM, which can solve small sample learning problems better.

Compared to previous methods like Conditional Random Fields, Maximum Entropy Markov Models and label sequence boosting, HM-SVMs have a number of advantages. Most notably, it is possible to learn non-linear discriminant functions via kernel functions.

However, for some machines, it is difficult to obtain massive labeled data. Moreover, even though labeled data can be obtained from some machines, the intelligent fault diagnosis method trained with such labeled data possibly fails in classifying unlabeled data acquired from the other machines due to data distribution discrepancy. These problems limit the successful applications of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines with unlabeled data. As a potential tool, transfer learning adapts a model trained in a source domain to its application in a target domain. Based on the transfer learning, we propose a new intelligent method named deep convolutional transfer learning network (DCTLN). A DCTLN consists of two modules: condition recognition and domain adaptation. The condition recognition module is constructed by a one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn features and recognize health conditions of machines. The domain adaptation module facilitates the 1-D CNN to learn domain-invariant features by maximizing domain recognition errors and minimizing the probability distribution distance.

Moreover, it is shown in this paper that all the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised ELMs can actually be put into a unified framework. This provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of random feature mapping, which is the key concept in ELM theory.

Designated the International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP), the MIT study explored the differences between mass production and lean production in the automobile industry. Lean production, pioneered by Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno at the Toyota Motor Company in Japan, combines the advantages of craft and mass production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the rigidity of the latter. Toward this end, lean producers employ teams of multiskilled workers at all levels of the organization and use highly flexible, increasingly automated machines to produce volumes of products in enormous variety. Lean production (a term coined by IMVP researcher John Krafcik) is \"lean\" because it uses less of everything compared with mass production. Also, it requires keeping far less than half the needed inventory on site, results in many fewer defects, and produces a greater and ever growing variety of products. Lean production changes how people work. Most will find their jobs more challenging and will become more productive, but, at the same time, they may find their work more stressful. Lean production calls for learning far more professional skills (than in mass production) and applying these creatively in a team setting (rather than a rigid hierarchy). This book is organized in three sections. The first, \"The Origins of Lean Production,\" traces the evolution of lean production. The second, \"The Elements of Lean Production,\" looks at how lean production works in factory operations, product development, supply-system coordination, customer relations and as a total lean enterprise. Finally, in the third section, \"Diffusing Lean Production,\" the authors examine how lean production is spreading across the world and to other industries and, in the process, is revolutionizing how people live and work. Also examined are the barriers that are preventing companies and countries from becoming lean.

After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length.

The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification.

Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems. A more detailed overview of the theory (without proofs) can be found in Vapnik (1995).

However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2\u03bb/n, where \u03bb is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine.

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines.

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service.

Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 429, "citationCount": 1723, "influentialCitationCount": 81, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2373318", "name": "B.
