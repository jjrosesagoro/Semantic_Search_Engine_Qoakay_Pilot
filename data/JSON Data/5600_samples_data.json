While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available.

However, most structure modeling approaches only use the template-based contact predictions in guiding the simulations; this is partly because the sequence-based contact predictions are usually considered to be less accurate than that by threading. With the rapid progress in sequence databases and machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to have a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the contact-prediction methods in different template conditions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe develop two methods for protein-contact predictions: SVM-SEQ is a sequence-based machine learning approach which trains a variety of sequence-derived features on contact maps; SVM-LOMETS collects consensus contact predictions from multiple threading templates. We test both methods on the same set of 554 proteins which are categorized into 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard' and 'Very Hard' targets based on the evolutionary and structural distance between templates and targets. For the Easy and Medium targets, SVM-LOMETS obviously outperforms SVM-SEQ; but for the Hard and Very Hard targets, the accuracy of the SVM-SEQ predictions is higher than that of SVM-LOMETS by 12-25%. If we combine the SVM-SEQ and SVM-LOMETS predictions together, the total number of correctly predicted contacts in the Hard proteins will increase by more than 60% (or 70% for the long-range contact with a sequence separation > or =24), compared with SVM-LOMETS alone. The advantage of SVM-SEQ is also shown in the CASP7 free modeling targets where the SVM-SEQ is around four times more accurate than SVM-LOMETS in the long-range contact prediction. These data demonstrate that the state-of-the-art sequence-based contact prediction has reached a level which may be helpful in assisting tertiary structure modeling for the targets which do not have close structure templates.

Although most techniques developed so far requires knowledge of the architecture of the machine learning model and remains hard to scale to complex prediction pipelines, the method of randomized smoothing has been shown to overcome many of these obstacles. By requiring only black-box access to the underlying model, randomized smoothing scales to large architectures and is agnostic to the internals of the network. However, past work on randomized smoothing has focused on restricted classes of smoothing measures or perturbations (like Gaussian or discrete) and has only been able to prove robustness with respect to simple norm bounds. In this paper we introduce a general framework for proving robustness properties of smoothed machine learning models in the black-box setting.

Besides predicting the text\u2019s category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place.

We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information.

However, the traditional L1MKL method often achieves worse results than the simplest method using the average of base kernels (i.e., average kernel) in some practical applications. In order to improve the effectiveness of MKL, this paper presents a novel soft margin perspective for MKL. Specifically, we introduce an additional slack variable called kernel slack variable to each quadratic constraint of MKL, which corresponds to one support vector machine model using a single base kernel. We first show that L1MKL can be deemed as hard margin MKL, and then we propose a novel soft margin framework for MKL. Three commonly used loss functions, including the hinge loss, the square hinge loss, and the square loss, can be readily incorporated into this framework, leading to the new soft margin MKL objective functions. Many existing MKL methods can be shown as special cases under our soft margin framework. For example, the hinge loss soft margin MKL leads to a new box constraint for kernel combination coefficients. Using different hyper-parameter values for this formulation, we can inherently bridge the method using average kernel, L1MKL, and the hinge loss soft margin MKL. The square hinge loss soft margin MKL unifies the family of elastic net constraint/regularizer based approaches; and the square loss soft margin MKL incorporates L2MKL naturally. Moreover, we also develop efficient algorithms for solving both the hinge loss and square hinge loss soft margin MKL.

These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators. We demonstrate the advantages of GPipe by training large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures: (i) Image Classification: We train a 557-million-parameter AmoebaNet model and attain a top-1 accuracy of 84.4% on ImageNet-2012, (ii) Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: We train a single 6-billion-parameter, 128-layer Transformer model on a corpus spanning over 100 languages and achieve better quality than all bilingual models.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 770, "influentialCitationCount": 111, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2145438541", "name": "Yanping Huang"}, {"authorId": "50607661", "name": "Yonglong Cheng"}, {"authorId": "7167328", "name": "Dehao Chen"}, {"authorId": "34946720", "name": "HyoukJoong Lee"}, {"authorId": "2020608", "name": "Jiquan Ngiam"}, {"authorId": "2827616", "name": "Quoc V.

The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.\n\n\nResults\nThe EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 4144, "influentialCitationCount": 115, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3236386", "name": "Varun Gulshan"}, {"authorId": "49506408", "name": "L.

We employ state-of-the-art machine learning methods to assay and improve the accuracy of the genome annotation of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

In 87% (coding and untranslated regions) and 95% (coding regions only) of all genes tested in several out-of-sample evaluations, our method correctly identified all exons and introns. Notably, only 37% and 50%, respectively, of the presently unconfirmed genes in the C. elegans genome annotation agree with our predictions, thus we hypothesize that a sizable fraction of those genes are not correctly annotated. A retrospective evaluation of the Wormbase WS120 annotation [1] of C. elegans reveals that splice form predictions on unconfirmed genes in WS120 are inaccurate in about 18% of the considered cases, while our predictions deviate from the truth only in 10%\u201313%. We experimentally analyzed 20 controversial genes on which our system and the annotation disagree, confirming the superiority of our predictions. While our method correctly predicted 75% of those cases, the standard annotation was never completely correct.

This development should lead to sustainable manufacturing using new technologies. To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as machine learning, have already been established in the industry to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 96, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "77613442", "name": "R.

The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches, and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks regarding operation and optimization cost effectively. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self-adaptive, and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of ML, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive.

It has been successfully applied to modeling the visual receptive fields of the cortical neurons. Sufficient experimental results in neuroscience suggest that the temporal slowness principle is a general learning principle in visual perception. In this paper, we introduce the SFA framework to the problem of human action recognition by incorporating the discriminative information with SFA learning and considering the spatial relationship of body parts. In particular, we consider four kinds of SFA learning strategies, including the original unsupervised SFA (U-SFA), the supervised SFA (S-SFA), the discriminative SFA (D-SFA), and the spatial discriminative SFA (SD--SFA), to extract slow feature functions from a large amount of training cuboids which are obtained by random sampling in motion boundaries. Afterward, to represent action sequences, the squared first order temporal derivatives are accumulated over all transformed cuboids into one feature vector, which is termed the Accumulated Squared Derivative (ASD) feature. The ASD feature encodes the statistical distribution of slow features in an action sequence. Finally, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify actions represented by ASD features. We conduct extensive experiments, including two sets of control experiments, two sets of large scale experiments on the KTH and Weizmann databases, and two sets of experiments on the CASIA and UT-interaction databases, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SFA for human action recognition. Experimental results suggest that the SFA-based approach (1) is able to extract useful motion patterns and improves the recognition performance, (2) requires less intermediate processing steps but achieves comparable or even better performance, and (3) has good potential to recognize complex multiperson activities.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 289, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2156120959", "name": "Zhang Zhang"}, {"authorId": "143719920", "name": "D.
