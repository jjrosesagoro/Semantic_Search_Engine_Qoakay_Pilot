Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data. \n \nThe history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique [1] for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences [2] employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) [3] and neocognitron [4] were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data. \n \nThis tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed.

Overview Dataset shift is a challenging situation where the joint distribution of inputs and outputs differs between the training and test stages. Covariate shift is a simpler particular case of dataset shift where only the input distribution changes (covariate denotes input), while the conditional distribution of the outputs given the inputs p(y|x) remains unchanged. Dataset shift is present in most practical applications for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by experimental design, to the mere irreproducibility of the testing conditions at training time. For example, in an image classification task, training data might have been recorded under controlled laboratory conditions, whereas the test data may show different lighting conditions. In other applications, the process that generates data is in itself adaptive. Some of our authors consider the problem of spam email filtering: successful \" spammers \" will try to build spam in a form that differs from the spam the automatic filter has been built on. Dataset shift seems to have raised relatively little interest in the machine learning community until very recently. Indeed, many machine learning algorithms are based on the assumption that the training data is drawn from exactly the same distribution as the test data on which the model will later be evaluated. Semi-supervised learning and active learning, two problems that seem very similar to covariate shift have received much more attention. How do they differ from covariate shift? Semi-supervised learning is designed to take advantage of unlabeled data present at training time, but is not conceived to be robust against changes in the input distribution. In fact, one can easily construct examples of covariate shift for which common SSL strategies such as the \" cluster assumption \" will lead to disaster. In active learning the algorithm is asked to select from the available unlabeled inputs those for which obtaining the label will be most beneficial for learning. This is very relevant in contexts where labeling data is very costly, but active learning strategies 2 Contents are not specifically design for dealing with covariate shift.

As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples.

Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging.

The Problem of Irrelevant Features accuracy) to grow slowly with the number of irrele- vant attributes. Theoretical results for algorithms that search restricted hypothesis spaces are encouraging. For instance, the worst-case number of errors made by Littlestone's (1987) WINNOW method grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant features. Pazzani and Sarrett's (1992) average-case analysis for WHOLIST, a simple conjunctive algorithm, and Lang- ley and Iba's (1993) treatment of the naive Bayesian classifier, suggest that their sample complexities grow at most linearly with the number of irrelevant features. However, the theoretical results are less optimistic for induction methods that search a larger space of concept descriptions. For example, Langley and Iba's (1993) average-case analysis of simple nearest neighbor indicates that its sample complexity grows exponen- tially with the number of irrelevant attributes, even for conjunctive target concepts. Experimental stud- ies of nearest neighbor are consistent with this conclu- sion, and other experiments suggest that similar results hold even for induction algorithms that explicitly se- lect features. For example, the sample complexity for decision-tree methods appears to grow linearly with the number of irrelevants for conjunctive concepts, but exponentially for parity concepts, since the evaluation metric cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant fea- tures in the latter situation (Langley & Sage, in press). Results of this sort have encouraged machine learn- ing researchers to explore more sophisticated methods for selecting relevant features.

Traditionally, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) where all the data is unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm (e.g., classification, regression) where all the data is labeled.The goal of semi-supervised learning is to understand how combining labeled and unlabeled data may change the learning behavior, and design algorithms that take advantage of such a combination. Semi-supervised learning is of great interest in machine learning and data mining because it can use readily available unlabeled data to improve supervised learning tasks when the labeled data is scarce or expensive. Semi-supervised learning also shows potential as a quantitative tool to understand human category learning, where most of the input is self-evidently unlabeled. In this introductory book, we present some popular semi-supervised learning models, including self-training, mixture models, co-training and multiview learning, graph-based methods, and semi-supervised support vector machines. For each model, we discuss its basic mathematical formulation. The success of semi-supervised learning depends critically on some underlying assumptions. We emphasize the assumptions made by each model and give counterexamples when appropriate to demonstrate the limitations of the different models. In addition, we discuss semi-supervised learning for cognitive psychology.

Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments.

For example, a learning system for medical diagnosis might be trained with examples of patients whose case records (medical tests, clinical observations) and diagnoses were known. The task of the learning system is to infer a function that predicts the diagnosis of a patient from his or her case records. The function to be learned might be represented as a set of rules, a decision tree, a Bayes network, or a neural network. Learning algorithms essentially operate by searching some space of functions (usually called the hypothesis class) for a function that fits the given data. Because there are usually exponentially many functions, this search cannot actually examine individual hypothesis functions but instead must use some more direct method of constructing the hypothesis functions from the data. This search can usually be formalized by defining an objective function (e.g., number of data points predicted incorrectly) and applying various algorithms to find a function that minimizes this objective function is NP-hard. For example, fitting the weights of a neural network or finding the smallest decision tree are both NP-complete problems [Blum and Rivest, 1989; Quinlan and Rivest 1989]. Hence, heuristic algorithms such as gradient descent (for neural networks) and greedy search (for decision trees) have been applied with great success. Of course, the suboptimality of such heuristic algorithms ~mmediately suggests a reas&able line of research: find ~lgorithms that can search the hypothesis class better. Hence, there has been extensive research in applying secondorder methods to fit neural networks and in conducting much more thorough searches in learning decision trees and rule sets. Ironically, when these algorithms were tested on real datasets, it was found that their performance was often worse than simrde szradient descent or greedy sear~h [&inlan and Cameron-Jones 1995; Weigend 1994]. In short: it appears to be bet~er not to optimize! One of the other important trends in machine-learning research has been the establishment and nurturing of connections between various previously disparate fields, including computational learning theory, connectionist learning, symbolic learning. and statistics. The . connection to statistics was crucial in resolvins$ this naradox. The-key p~oblem arises from the structure of the machine-learning task, A learning algorithm is trained on a set of training data, but then it is applied to make predictions on new data points. The goal is to maximize its predictive accuracy on the new data points\u2014not necessarily its accuracy on the trammg data.

It shows that the interactive learning and retrieval process can find correct images increasingly. It also shows the generalization ability of SVM under the condition of limited training samples.", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 301, "influentialCitationCount": 28, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39089563", "name": "Lei Zhang"}, {"authorId": "38222706", "name": "Fuzong Lin"}, {"authorId": "49846744", "name": "Bo Zhang"}]}, {"paperId": "5052871d430b803b4c59f459bb26b1f76e56736e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5052871d430b803b4c59f459bb26b1f76e56736e", "title": "Evaluation and selection of biases in machine learning", "abstract": null, "year": 1995, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 113, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145152778", "name": "D.

Yes. Over the past decade, machine learning has evolved from a field of laboratory demonstrations to a field of significant commercial value. Machine-learning algorithms have now learned to detect credit card fraud by mining data on past transactions, learned to steer vehicles driving autonomously on public highways at 70 miles an hour, and learned the reading interests of many individuals to assemble personally customized electronic newsAbstracts. A new computational theory of learning is beginning to shed light on fundamental issues, such as the trade-off among the number of training examples available, the number of hypotheses considered, and the likely accuracy of the learned hypothesis. Newer research is beginning to explore issues such as long-term learning of new representations, the integration of Bayesian inference and induction, and life-long cumulative learning. This article, based on the keynote talk presented at the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, samples a number of recent accomplishments in machine learning and looks at where the field might be headed.
