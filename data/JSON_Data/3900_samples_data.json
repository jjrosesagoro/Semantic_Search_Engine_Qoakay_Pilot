The latter rely on a multimodel ensemble built for ozone forecasting with the modeling system Polyphemus. The ensemble simulations are obtained by changes in the physical parameterizations, the numerical schemes, and the input data to the models. The simulations are carried out for summer 2001 over western Europe in order to forecast ozone daily peaks and ozone hourly concentrations. On the basis of past observations and past model forecasts, the learning algorithms produce a weight for each model. A convex or linear combination of the model forecasts is then formed with these weights. This process is repeated for each round of forecasting and is therefore called sequential aggregation. The aggregated forecasts demonstrate good results; for instance, they always show better performance than the best model in the ensemble and they even compete against the best constant linear combination. In addition, the machine learning algorithms come with theoretical guarantees with respect to their performance, that hold for all possible sequences of observations, even nonstochastic ones. Our study also demonstrates the robustness of the methods. We therefore conclude that these aggregation methods are very relevant for operational forecasts.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 74, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1850643", "name": "V.

A GP is nonparametric, meaning that the complexity of the model grows as more data points are received. Another attractive feature is the behaviour of the error bars. They naturally grow in regions away from training data where we have high uncertainty about the interpolating function. In their standard form GPs have several limitations, which can be divided into two broad categories: computational difficulties for large data sets, and restrictive modelling assumptions for complex data sets. This thesis addresses various aspects of both of these problems. The training cost for a GP has 0(N3) complexity, where N is the number of training data points. This is due to an inversion of the N x N covariance matrix. In this thesis we develop several new techniques to reduce this complexity to 0(NM2), where M is a user chosen number much smaller than N. The sparse approximation we use is based on a set of M 'pseudo-inputs' which are optimised together with hyperparameters at training time. We develop a further approximation based on clustering inputs that can be seen as a mixture of local and global approximations. Standard GPs assume a uniform noise variance. We use our sparse approximation described above as a way of relaxing this assumption. By making a modification of the sparse covariance function, we can model input dependent noise. To handle high dimensional data sets we use supervised linear dimensionality reduction. As another extension of the standard GP, we relax the Gaussianity assumption of the process by learning a nonlinear transformation of the output space. All these techniques further increase the applicability of GPs to real complex data sets. We present empirical comparisons of our algorithms with various competing techniques, and suggest problem dependent strategies to follow in practice.", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 138, "influentialCitationCount": 26, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2081889", "name": "Edward Snelson"}]}, {"paperId": "431a1a620b762750ac92b35d97de67169eb8069c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/431a1a620b762750ac92b35d97de67169eb8069c", "title": "DLAU: A Scalable Deep Learning Accelerator Unit on FPGA", "abstract": "As the emerging field of machine learning, deep learning shows excellent ability in solving complex learning problems.

From a dataset consisting of 2000 phishing and ham emails, a set of prominent phishing email features (identified from the literature) were extracted and used by the machine learning algorithm with a resulting classification accuracy of 99.7% and low false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) rates.", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 123, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2555593", "name": "A.

The detection of faults and fault patterns is a challenging part of machinery fault diagnosis. To tackle this problem, a model for deep statistical feature learning from vibration measurements of rotating machinery is presented in this paper. Vibration sensor signals collected from rotating mechanical systems are represented in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains, each of which is then used to produce a statistical feature set. For learning statistical features, real-value Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GRBMs) are stacked to develop a Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM). The suggested approach is applied as a deep statistical feature learning tool for both gearbox and bearing systems. The fault classification performances in experiments using this approach are 95.17% for the gearbox, and 91.75% for the bearing system. The proposed approach is compared to such standard methods as a support vector machine, GRBM and a combination model.

Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were <10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 92, "citationCount": 80, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Environmental Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1491595275", "name": "H.

This creates cubically many parameters, which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations. We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real image sequences.

Concurrently, a separate line of research has tackled a very similar problem: In digital watermarking, a pattern is embedded in a signal in the presence of an adversary. As a consequence, this research field has also extensively studied techniques for attacking and defending watermarking methods. The two research communities have worked in parallel so far, unnoticeably developing similar attack and defense strategies. This paper is a first effort to bring these communities together. To this end, we present a unified notation of blackbox attacks against machine learning and watermarking. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply concepts from watermarking to machine learning and vice versa. We show that countermeasures from watermarking can mitigate recent model-extraction attacks and, similarly, that techniques for hardening machine learning can fend off oracle attacks against watermarks.

However, since these systems are based on a dedicated cluster of physical or virtual machines, they have posed non-trivial cluster management overhead to machine learning practitioners and data scientists. In addition, there exists an inherent mismatch between the dynamically varying resource demands during a model training job and the inflexible resource provisioning model of current cluster-based systems.In this paper, we propose SIREN, an asynchronous distributed machine learning framework based on the emerging serverless architecture, with which stateless functions can be executed in the cloud without the complexity of building and maintaining virtual machine infrastructures. With SIREN, we are able to achieve a higher level of parallelism and elasticity by using a swarm of stateless functions, each working on a different batch of data, while greatly reducing system configuration overhead. Furthermore, we propose a scheduler based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to dynamically control the number and memory size of the stateless functions that should be used in each training epoch. The scheduler learns from the training process itself, in pursuit for the minimum possible training time given a cost. With our real-world prototype implementation on AWS Lambda, extensive experimental results have shown that SIREN can reduce model training time by up to 44%, as compared to traditional machine learning training benchmarks on AWS EC2 at the same cost.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 16, "citationCount": 64, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39483391", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "1714907", "name": "Di Niu"}, {"authorId": "91269142", "name": "Baochun Li"}]}, {"paperId": "b107a64c9dc343ac35231c7959090bbc3059203f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b107a64c9dc343ac35231c7959090bbc3059203f", "title": "Distributed Statistical Machine Learning in Adversarial Settings", "abstract": "We consider the distributed statistical learning problem over decentralized systems that are prone to adversarial attacks. This setup arises in many practical applications, including Google's Federated Learning. Formally, we focus on a decentralized system that consists of a parameter server and m working machines; each working machine keeps N/m data samples, where N is the total number of samples. In each iteration, up to q of the m working machines suffer Byzantine faults -- a faulty machine in the given iteration behaves arbitrarily badly against the system and has complete knowledge of the system. Additionally, the sets of faulty machines may be different across iterations. Our goal is to design robust algorithms such that the system can learn the underlying true parameter, which is of dimension d, despite the interruption of the Byzantine attacks. In this paper, based on the geometric median of means of the gradients, we propose a simple variant of the classical gradient descent method. We show that our method can tolerate q Byzantine failures up to 2(1+\u03b5)q \u2264 for an arbitrarily small but fixed constant \u03b5 > 0. The parameter estimate converges in O(log N) rounds with an estimation error on the order of max{\u221adq/N, \u221ad/N, which is larger than the minimax-optimal error rate \u221ad/N in the centralized and failure-free setting by at most a factor of \u221aq. The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of O((Nd/m) log N) at each working machine and O(md + kd log3 N) at the central server, and the total communication cost is of O(m d log N). We further provide an application of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated gradients.

As a result, a target-domain party can build more flexible and powerful models by leveraging rich labels from a source-domain party. A secure transfer cross validation approach is also proposed to guard the FTL performance under the federation.

Paraphrasing is important in fields such as text reuse in journalism, anonymizing work, and improving the quality of customer-written reviews. This article contributes to paraphrase acquisition and focuses on two aspects that are not addressed by current research: (1) acquisition via crowdsourcing, and (2) acquisition of passage-level samples. The challenge of the first aspect is automatic quality assurance; without such a means the crowdsourcing paradigm is not effective, and without crowdsourcing the creation of test corpora is unacceptably expensive for realistic order of magnitudes. The second aspect addresses the deficit that most of the previous work in generating and evaluating paraphrases has been conducted using sentence-level paraphrases or shorter; these short-sample analyses are limited in terms of application to plagiarism detection, for example. We present the Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011 (Webis-CPC-11), which recently formed part of the PAN 2010 international plagiarism detection competition. This corpus comprises passage-level paraphrases with 4067 positive samples and 3792 negative samples that failed our criteria, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk for crowdsourcing. In this article, we review the lessons learned at PAN 2010, and explain in detail the method used to construct the corpus. The empirical contributions include machine learning experiments to explore if passage-level paraphrases can be identified in a two-class classification problem using paraphrase similarity features, and we find that a k-nearest-neighbor classifier can correctly distinguish between paraphrased and nonparaphrased samples with 0.980 precision at 0.523 recall.

In this population, machine learning algorithms developed to predict 30-d mortality performed well on discrimination (c-statistic), calibration (assessed by calibration slope and intercept), Brier score, and decision analysis. An open access web application was developed for the best performing model and this web application can be found here: https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/spinemets/.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMachine learning algorithms are promising for prediction of postoperative outcomes in spinal oncology and these algorithms can be integrated into clinically useful decision tools. As the volume of data in oncology continues to grow, creation of learning systems and deployment of these systems as accessible tools may significantly enhance prognostication and management.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 66, "citationCount": 80, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5134422", "name": "A.

The interpretation of machine learning models is currently a hot topic in the information visualization community, with results showing that insights from machine learning models can lead to better predictions and improve the trustworthiness of the results. Due to this, multiple (and extensive) survey articles have been published recently trying to summarize the high number of original research papers published on the topic.

We have chosen to focus in detail on the principle properties of the signature which we believe are fundamental to understanding its role in applications.

The signature approach represents a non-parametric way for extraction of characteristic features from data. The data are converted into a multi-dimensional path by means of various embedding algorithms and then processed for computation of individual terms of the signature which summarise certain information contained in the data.

In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client.

Similar to the original formulation of Boltzmann machines, these models can be viewed as a stochastic counterpart of Hopfield networks, but where stochasticity is induced by a random mask over the connections. Synaptic stochasticity plays the dual role of an efficient mechanism for sampling, and a regularizer during learning akin to DropConnect. A local synaptic plasticity rule implementing an event-driven form of contrastive divergence enables the learning of generative models in an on-line fashion. S2Ms perform equally well using discrete-timed artificial units (as in Hopfield networks) or continuous-timed leaky integrate and fire neurons. The learned representations are remarkably sparse and robust to reductions in bit precision and synapse pruning: removal of more than 75% of the weakest connections followed by cursory re-learning causes a negligible performance loss on benchmark classification tasks.

In this thesis we will study the general setting of optimizing (minimizing) a convex function over a compact convex domain. In the first part of this thesis, we study a simple iterative approximation algorithm for that class of optimization problems, based on the classical method by Frank & Wolfe. The algorithm only relies on supporting hyperplanes to the function that we need to optimize. In each iteration, we move slightly towards a point which (approximately) minimizes the linear function given by the supporting hyperplane at the current point, where the minimum is taken over the original optimization domain. In contrast to gradient-descent-type methods, this algorithm does not need any projection steps in order to stay inside the optimization domain. Our framework generalizes the sparse greedy algorithm of Frank & Wolfe and its recent primal-dual analysis by Clarkson (and the low-rank SDP approach by Hazan) to arbitrary compact convex domains. Analogously, we give a convergence proof guaranteeing e-small error \u2014 which in our context is the duality gap \u2014 after O( 1e ) iterations. This method allows us to understand the sparsity of approximate solutions for any `1-regularized convex optimization problem (and for optimization over the simplex), expressed as a function of the approximation quality. Here we obtain matching upper and lower bounds of \u0398 ( 1 e ) for the sparsity. The same bounds apply to low-rank semidefinite optimization with bounded trace, showing that rank O ( 1 e ) is best possible here as well. For some classes of geometric optimization problems, our algorithm has a simple geometric interpretation, which is also known as the coreset concept. Here we will study linear classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM) and perceptrons, as well as general distance computations between convex hulls (or polytopes).

SVM is a technique that can be derived from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless, the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem.

In this paper, we show how normal operations of power networks can be statistically distinguished from the case under stealthy attacks. We propose two machine-learning-based techniques for stealthy attack detection. The first method utilizes supervised learning over labeled data and trains a distributed support vector machine (SVM). The design of the distributed SVM is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which offers provable optimality and convergence rate. The second method requires no training data and detects the deviation in measurements.

Furthermore, the objective for the classifier (label prediction) is not explicitly coupled to the objective for the tracker (estimation of object position). In this paper, we present a framework for adaptive visual object tracking based on structured output prediction. By explicitly allowing the output space to express the needs of the tracker, we avoid the need for an intermediate classification step. Our method uses a kernelised structured output support vector machine (SVM), which is learned online to provide adaptive tracking.

Existing fault-diagnosis methods rely on expert knowledge or extensive feature extraction, which is also highly dependent on expert knowledge. Additionally, most methods for fault diagnosis of transmission lines require multiple separate subalgorithms for fault classification and location performing each function independently and sequentially. In this research, an integrated framework combining fault classification and location is proposed by applying an innovative machine-learning algorithm: the summation-wavelet extreme learning machine (SW-ELM) that integrates feature extraction in the learning process. As a further contribution, an extension of the SW-ELM, i.e., the summation-Gaussian extreme learning machine (SG-ELM), is proposed and successfully applied to transmission line fault diagnosis. SG-ELM is fully self-learning and does not require ad-hoc feature extraction, making it deployable with minimum expert subjectivity. The developed framework is applied to three transmission-line topologies without any prior parameter tuning or ad-hoc feature extraction.

Despite this, many systems are built with standard, predefined filter banks that are not optimized for that particular application. Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images. In both applications, a combination of learning objectives outperformed purely discriminative or generative learning, increasing, for instance, the lung tissue classification accuracy by 1 to 8 percentage points.

Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding, and adaptation.

To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift.

PUFs use the inherent physical differences of every chip to either securely authenticate the chip or generate cryptographic keys without the need of nonvolatile memory. However, PUFs have shown to be vulnerable to model building attacks if the attacker has access to challenge and response pairs. In these model building attacks, machine learning is used to determine the internal parameters of the PUF to build an accurate software model. Nevertheless, PUFs are still a promising building block and several protocols and designs have been proposed that are believed to be resistant against machine learning attacks. In this paper, we take a closer look at two such protocols, one based on reverse fuzzy extractors and one based on pattern matching. We show that it is possible to attack these protocols using machine learning despite the fact that an attacker does not have access to direct challenge and response pairs. The introduced attacks demonstrate that even highly obfuscated responses can be used to attack PUF protocols. Hence, this paper shows that even protocols in which it would be computationally infeasible to compute enough challenge and response pairs for a direct machine learning attack can be attacked using machine learning.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 84, "influentialCitationCount": 19, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "4277384", "name": "G.
