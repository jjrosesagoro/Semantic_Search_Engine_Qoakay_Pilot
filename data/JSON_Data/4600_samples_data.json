Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. Patients: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors.

The aim of countless careers has been to build intelligent machines that can interpret the world as humans do, understand language, and learn from realworld examples. In the early part of this century, two events coincided that transformed the field of aI. The advent of widely available Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) meant that parallel processing was faster, cheaper, and more powerful. at the same time, the era of \u2018Big Data\u2019 \u2013 images, text, bioinformatics, medical records, and financial transactions, among others \u2013 was moving firmly into the mainstream, along with almost limitless data storage. These factors led to a dramatic resurgence in interest in aI in both academic circles and industries outside traditional computer science. once again, aI occupies the zeitgeist, and is poised to transform medicine at a basic science, clinical, healthcare management, and financial level. Terminology surrounding these technologies continues to evolve and can be a source of confusion for non-computer scientists. aI is broadly classified as: general aI, machines that replicate human thought, emotion, and reason (and remain, for now, in the realm of science fiction); and narrow aI, technologies that can perform specific tasks as well as, or better than, humans. Machine learning (Ml) is the study of computer algorithms that can learn complex relationships or patterns from empirical data and make accurate decisions.2 Rather than coding specific sets of instructions to accomplish a task, the machine is \u2018trained\u2019 using large amounts of data and algorithms that confer it the ability to learn how to perform the task. Unlike normal algorithms, it is the data that \u2018tells\u2019 the machine what the \u2018good answer\u2019 is, and learning occurs without explicit programming. Ml problems can be classified as supervised learning or unsupervised learning.3 In a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as face recognition, the machine is shown several examples of \u2018face\u2019 or \u2018non-face\u2019 and the algorithm learns to predict whether an unseen image is a face or not. In unsupervised learning, the images shown to the machine are not labelled as \u2018face\u2019 or \u2018non-face\u2019. artificial Neural Networks (aNN)4 are one group of algorithms used for machine learning. While aNNs have existed for over 60 years, they fell out of favour during the 1990s and 2000s. In the last half-decade, aNNs have had a resurgence under a new name: deep artificial networks (or \u2018Deep learning\u2019). aNNs are uniquely poised to take full advantage of the computational boost offered by GPUs, allowing them to crunch through data sets of enormous sizes. These range from computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, face recognition, and optical character recognition (ocR), to natural language processing and even gameplaying problems (from mastering simple atari games to the recent alphaGo victory against human grandmasters).5 aNNs work by constructing layers upon layers of simple processing units (often referred to as \u2018neurons\u2019), interconnected via many differentially weighted connections. aNNs are \u2018trained\u2019 by using backpropagation algorithms, essentially telling the machine how to alter the internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous Artificial intelligence, machine learning and the evolution of healthcare", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount": 64, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2117137636", "name": "L.

Our framework consists of a principled way of deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training examples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing NMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines.

However, most existing work on federated learning adopts machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the clients through a self-learning quantization factor. Theoretical proofs of the convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced weight divergence are given. On the basis of FTTQ, we propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems.

We systematically evaluate the performance of various popular feature extraction, feature selection, feature smoothing and pattern classification methods with the DEAP dataset and a newly developed dataset called SEED for this study. Discriminative Graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine with differential entropy features achieves the best average accuracies of 69.67 and 91.07 percent on the DEAP and SEED datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that stable patterns exhibit consistency across sessions; the lateral temporal areas activate more for positive emotions than negative emotions in beta and gamma bands; the neural patterns of neutral emotions have higher alpha responses at parietal and occipital sites; and for negative emotions, the neural patterns have significant higher delta responses at parietal and occipital sites and higher gamma responses at prefrontal sites. The performance of our emotion recognition models shows that the neural patterns are relatively stable within and between sessions.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 74, "citationCount": 380, "influentialCitationCount": 37, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3108302", "name": "Wei-Long Zheng"}, {"authorId": "2682019", "name": "Jia-Yi Zhu"}, {"authorId": "1715839", "name": "Bao-Liang Lu"}]}, {"paperId": "747cf363b9e76cb469728add606f20ded772bff6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/747cf363b9e76cb469728add606f20ded772bff6", "title": "Automatic MeSH term assignment and quality assessment", "abstract": "For computational purposes documents or other objects are most often represented by a collection of individual attributes that may be strings or numbers.

This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve.

Modern graphics techniques have succeeded in synthesizing photo\u2010realistic images from hand\u2010crafted scene representations. However, the automatic generation of shape, materials, lighting, and other aspects of scenes remains a challenging problem that, if solved, would make photo\u2010realistic computer graphics more widely accessible. Concurrently, progress in computer vision and machine learning have given rise to a new approach to image synthesis and editing, namely deep generative models. Neural rendering is a new and rapidly emerging field that combines generative machine learning techniques with physical knowledge from computer graphics, e.g., by the integration of differentiable rendering into network training. With a plethora of applications in computer graphics and vision, neural rendering is poised to become a new area in the graphics community, yet no survey of this emerging field exists. This state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art report summarizes the recent trends and applications of neural rendering. We focus on approaches that combine classic computer graphics techniques with deep generative models to obtain controllable and photorealistic outputs. Starting with an overview of the underlying computer graphics and machine learning concepts, we discuss critical aspects of neural rendering approaches. Specifically, our emphasis is on the type of control, i.e., how the control is provided, which parts of the pipeline are learned, explicit vs. implicit control, generalization, and stochastic vs. deterministic synthesis. The second half of this state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art report is focused on the many important use cases for the described algorithms such as novel view synthesis, semantic photo manipulation, facial and body reenactment, relighting, free\u2010viewpoint video, and the creation of photo\u2010realistic avatars for virtual and augmented reality telepresence.

We first introduce a digital DSGD (D-DSGD) scheme, assuming that the workers operate on the boundary of the MAC capacity region at each iteration of the DSGD algorithm, and digitize their estimates within the bit budget allowed by the employed power allocation. We then introduce an analog scheme, called A-DSGD, motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, where the workers send their gradient estimates over the MAC through the available channel bandwidth without employing any digital code. Numerical results show that A-DSGD converges much faster than D-DSGD. The improvement is particularly compelling at low power and low bandwidth regimes.

The widely-used minimum variance adaptive beamformer (MVAB) creates such filters using a sample covariance estimate; however, the quality of this estimate deteriorates when the sources are correlated or the number of samples n is small. Herein, a modified beamformer is derived that replaces this problematic sample covariance with a robust maximum likelihood estimate obtained using the relevance vector machine (RVM), a Bayesian method for learning sparse models from possibly overcomplete feature sets. We prove that this substitution has the natural ability to remove the undesirable effects of correlations or limited data.

Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data.

The challenge preventing this is largely caused by the discrepancy between the dynamical properties of synaptic plasticity and the requirements for gradient backpropagation. Learning algorithms that approximate gradient backpropagation using local error functions can overcome this challenge. Here, we introduce Deep Continuous Local Learning (DECOLLE), a spiking neural network equipped with local error functions for online learning with no memory overhead for computing gradients. DECOLLE is capable of learning deep spatio temporal representations from spikes relying solely on local information, making it compatible with neurobiology and neuromorphic hardware. Synaptic plasticity rules are derived systematically from user-defined cost functions and neural dynamics by leveraging existing autodifferentiation methods of machine learning frameworks. We benchmark our approach on the event-based neuromorphic dataset N-MNIST and DvsGesture, on which DECOLLE performs comparably to the state-of-the-art.

However, despite the significant cost benefits that these methods promise, they have seen a limited success in replacing the traditional specification testing, mainly due to the incurred test error which, albeit small, cannot meet industrial standards. To address this problem, we introduce a neural system that is trained not only to predict the pass/fail labels of devices based on a set of low-cost measurements, as aimed by the previous machine-learning-based test methods, but also to assess the confidence in this prediction. Devices for which this confidence is insufficient are then retested through the more expensive specification testing in order to reach an accurate test decision. Thus, this two-tier test approach sustains the high accuracy of specification testing while leveraging the low cost of machine-learning-based testing. In addition, by varying the desired level of confidence, it enables the exploration of the tradeoff between test cost and test accuracy and facilitates the development of cost-effective test plans. We discuss the structure and the training algorithm of an ontogenic neural network which is embodied in the neural system in the first tier, as well as the extraction of appropriate measurements such that only a small fraction of devices are funneled to the second tier.

We propose a framework that manages multiple shared CMP resources in a coordinated fashion to enforce higher-level performance objectives. We formulate global resource allocation as a machine learning problem. At runtime, our resource management scheme monitors the execution of each application, and learns a predictive model of system performance as a function of allocation decisions. By learning each application's performance response to different resource distributions, our approach makes it possible to anticipate the system-level performance impact of allocation decisions at runtime with little runtime overhead. As a result, it becomes possible to make reliable comparisons among different points in a vast and dynamically changing allocation space, allowing us to adapt our allocation decisions as applications undergo phase changes.

In inflectionally rich languages, such as Slovene, assigning the correct lemma (base form) to each word in a running text is not trivial, since for instance, nouns inflect for number and case, with a complex configuration of endings and stem modifications. The problem is especially difficult for unknown words, since word-forms cannot be matched against a morphological lexicon. This paper discusses a machine learning approach to the automatic lemmatization of unknown words in Slovene texts. We decompose the problem of learning to perform lemmatization into two subproblems: learning to perform morphosyntactic tagging of words in a text, and learning to perform morphological analysis, which produces the lemma from the word-form given the correct morphosyntactic tag. A statistics-based trigram tagger is used to learn morphosyntactic tagging and a first-order decision list learning system is used to learn rules for morphological analysis. We train the tagger on a manually annotated corpus consisting of 100,000 running words. We train the analyzer on open-class inflecting Slovene words, namely nouns, adjectives, and main verbs, together being characterized by more than 400 different morphosyntactic tags. The training set for the analyzer consists of a morphological lexicon containing 15,000 lemmas. We evaluate the learned model on word lists extracted from a corpus of Slovene texts containing 500,000 words, and show that our morphological analysis module achieves 98.6% accuracy, while the combination of the tagger and analyzer is 92.0% accurate on unknown inflecting Slovene words.", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount": 83, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1696434", "name": "T.

A machine learning random forest model was developed with 671 HRLs and tested with an independent set of 335 HRLs. Among the most important traditional features were age and HRL histologic results (eg, atypical ductal hyperplasia). An important text feature from the pathologic reports was \"severely atypical.\" Instead of surgical excision of all HRLs, if those categorized with the model to be at low risk for upgrade were surveilled and the remainder were excised, then 97.4% (37 of 38) of malignancies would have been diagnosed at surgery, and 30.6% (91 of 297) of surgeries of benign lesions could have been avoided. Conclusion This study provides proof of concept that a machine learning model can be applied to predict the risk of upgrade of HRLs to cancer. Use of this model could decrease unnecessary surgery by nearly one-third and could help guide clinical decision making with regard to surveillance versus surgical excision of HRLs. \u00a9 RSNA, 2017.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 36, "citationCount": 106, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "8306823", "name": "M.

We develop and analyze distributed algorithms based on dual subgradient averaging, and we provide sharp bounds on their convergence rates as a function of the network size and topology. Our analysis allows us to clearly separate the convergence of the optimization algorithm itself and the effects of communication dependent on the network structure. We show that the number of iterations required by our algorithm scales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and confirm this prediction's sharpness both by theoretical lower bounds and simulations for various networks.

Natural language processing is used to extract features from the input texts; these features are then used in the authors' machine-learning approaches. The authors used Conditional Random Fields for concept extraction, and Support Vector Machines for assertion and relation annotation. Depending on the task, the authors tested various combinations of rule-based and machine-learning methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe authors'assertion annotation system obtained an F-measure of 0.931, ranking fifth out of 21 participants at the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge. The authors' relation annotation system ranked third out of 16 participants with a 0.709 F-measure. The 0.773 F-measure the authors obtained on concept extraction did not make it to the top 10.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOn the one hand, the authors confirm that the use of only machine-learning methods is highly dependent on the annotated training data, and thus obtained better results for well-represented classes. On the other hand, the use of only a rule-based method was not sufficient to deal with new types of data.

First, I will argue that in the era of big data analytics we need an understanding of privacy that is capable of protecting what is uncountable, incalculable or incomputable about individual persons. To instigate this new dimension of the right to privacy, I expand previous work on the relational nature of privacy, and the productive indeterminacy of human identity it implies, into an ecological understanding of privacy, taking into account the technological environment that mediates the constitution of human identity. Second, I will investigate how machine learning actually works, detecting a series of design choices that inform the accuracy of the outcome, each entailing trade-offs that determine the relevance, validity and reliability of the algorithm\u2019s accuracy for real life problems. I argue that incomputability does not call for a rejection of machine learning per se but calls for a research design that enables those who will be affected by the algorithms to become involved and to learn how machines learn \u2014 resulting in a better understanding of their potential and limitations. A better understanding of the limitations that are inherent in machine learning will deflate some of the eschatological expectations, and provide for better decision-making about whether and if so how to implement machine learning in specific domains or contexts. I will highlight how a reliable research design aligns with purpose limitation as core to its methodological integrity. This Article, then, advocates a practice of \u201cagonistic machine learning\u201d that will contribute to responsible decisions about the integration of data-driven applications into our environments while simultaneously bringing them under the Rule of Law.
