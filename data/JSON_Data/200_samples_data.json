This thesis addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation based approach. The central hypothesis is that good feature sets contain features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. A feature evaluation formula, based on ideas from test theory, provides an operational definition of this hypothesis. CFS (Correlation based Feature Selection) is an algorithm that couples this evaluation formula with an appropriate correlation measure and a heuristic search strategy. CFS was evaluated by experiments on artificial and natural datasets. Three machine learning algorithms were used: C4.5 (a decision tree learner), IB1 (an instance based learner), and naive Bayes. Experiments on artificial datasets showed that CFS quickly identifies and screens irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features, and identifies relevant features as long as their relevance does not strongly depend on other features. On natural domains, CFS typically eliminated well over half the features. In most cases, classification accuracy using the reduced feature set equaled or bettered accuracy using the complete feature set. Feature selection degraded machine learning performance in cases where some features were eliminated which were highly predictive of very small areas of the instance space. Further experiments compared CFS with a wrapper\u2014a well known approach to feature selection that employs the target learning algorithm to evaluate feature sets. In many cases CFS gave comparable results to the wrapper, and in general, outperformed the wrapper on small datasets. CFS executes many times faster than the wrapper, which allows it to scale to larger datasets. Two methods of extending CFS to handle feature interaction are presented and experimentally evaluated. The first considers pairs of features and the second incorporates iii feature weights calculated by the RELIEF algorithm. Experiments on artificial domains showed that both methods were able to identify interacting features. On natural domains, the pairwise method gave more reliable results than using weights provided by RELIEF.", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 111, "citationCount": 3636, "influentialCitationCount": 443, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "118860642", "name": "M.

Assuming a set of n workers, up to f being Byzantine, we ask how resilient can SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient aggregation rule based on a linear combination of the vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property of the aggregation rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite f Byzantine workers.

In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work. Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 113, "citationCount": 562, "influentialCitationCount": 14, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144585578", "name": "W.

Therefore, if an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship between the performance of the machine learning models and their hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on standard test datasets.

Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors the state of software and hardware running in the network. Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques.

We propose that the expense of experimentally testing a large number of protein variants can be decreased and the outcome can be improved by incorporating machine learning with directed evolution. Simulations on an empirical fitness landscape demonstrate that the expected performance improvement is greater with this approach. Machine learning-assisted directed evolution from a single parent produced enzyme variants that selectively synthesize the enantiomeric products of a new-to-nature chemical transformation. By exploring multiple mutations simultaneously, machine learning efficiently navigates large regions of sequence space to identify improved proteins and also produces diverse solutions to engineering problems. To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously, we incorporate machine learning into the directed evolution workflow. Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine-learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (i.e., stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si\u2013H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee (enantiomeric excess).

We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models.

These interpretations have found uses both in their own right, e.g. medicine (1), policy-making (2), and science (3, 4), as well as in auditing the predictions themselves in response to issues such as regulatory pressure (5) and fairness (6). In the absence of a well-formed definition of interpretability, a broad range of methods with a correspondingly broad range of outputs (e.g. visualizations, natural language, mathematical equations) have been labeled as interpretation. This has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear what it means to interpret something, what common threads exist among disparate methods, and how to select an interpretation method for a particular problem/audience. In this paper, we attempt to address these concerns. To do so, we first define interpretability in the context of machine learning and place it within a generic data science life cycle. This allows us to distinguish between two main classes of interpretation methods: model-based\u2217 and post hoc.

Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation.

To this end, Foolbox provides reference implementations of most published adversarial attack methods alongside some new ones, all of which perform internal hyperparameter tuning to find the minimum adversarial perturbation.

A practical definition of the robustness R of a model, first used by Szegedy et al. (2013), is the average size of the minimum adversarial perturbation \u03c1(x) across many samples x, R = \u3008\u03c1(x)\u3009 x where (1) \u03c1(x) = min \u03b4 d(x,x+ \u03b4) s.t. x+ \u03b4 is adversarial (2) and d(\u00b7) is some distance measure. Unfortunately, finding the global minimum adversarial perturbation is close to impossible in any practical setting, and we thus employ heuristic attacks to find a suitable approximation. Such heuristics, however, can fail, in which case we could easily be mislead to believe that a model is robust (Brendel & Bethge, 2017). Our best strategy is thus to employ as many attacks as possible, and to use the minimal perturbation found across all attacks as an approximation to the true global minimum. At the moment, however, such a strategy is severely obstructed by two problems: first, the code for most known attack methods is either not available at all, or only available for one particular deep learning framework. Second, implementations of the same attack often differ in many details and are thus not directly comparable. Foolbox improves upon the existing Python package cleverhans by Papernot et al. (2016b) in three important aspects: 1. It interfaces with most popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, Lasagne and MXNet and provides a straight forward way to add support for other frameworks, 2. it provides reference implementations for more than 15 adversarial attacks with a simple and consistent API, and 3. it supports many different criteria for adversarial examples, including custom ones.

Netflix knows what movies people like to watch and Google knows what people want to know based on their search histories. Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non\u2013machine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors. It isnosurprisethenthatmedicineisawashwithclaims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians.1 Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians. It is our hope that elucidating these connections will demystify these techniques and provide a set of reasonable expectations for the role of machine learning and big data in health care. Machine learning was originally described as a program that learns to perform a task or make a decision automatically from data, rather than having the behavior explicitlyprogrammed.However,thisdefinitionisverybroad and could cover nearly any form of data-driven approach. For instance, consider the Framingham cardiovascular risk score,whichassignspointstovariousfactorsandproduces a number that predicts 10-year cardiovascular risk. Should this be considered an example of machine learning? The answer might obviously seem to be no. Closer inspection oftheFraminghamriskscorerevealsthattheanswermight not be as obvious as it first seems. The score was originally created2 by fitting a proportional hazards model to data frommorethan5300patients,andsothe\u201crule\u201dwasinfact learnedentirelyfromdata.Designatingariskscoreasamachine learning algorithm might seem a strange notion, but this example reveals the uncertain nature of the original definition of machine learning. It is perhaps more useful to imagine an algorithm as existing along a continuum between fully human-guided vs fully machine-guided data analysis. To understand the degree to which a predictive or diagnostic algorithm can said to be an instance of machine learning requires understanding how much of its structure or parameters were predetermined by humans. The trade-off between human specificationofapredictivealgorithm\u2019spropertiesvslearning those properties from data is what is known as the machine learning spectrum. Returning to the Framingham study, to create the original risk score statisticians and clinical experts worked together to make many important decisions, such as which variables to include in the model, therelationshipbetweenthedependentandindependent variables, and variable transformations and interactions. Since considerable human effort was used to define these properties, it would place low on the machine learning spectrum (#19 in the Figure and Supplement). Many evidence-based clinical practices are based on a statistical model of this sort, and so many clinical decisions in fact exist on the machine learning spectrum (middle left of Figure). On the extreme low end of the machine learning spectrum would be heuristics and rules of thumb that do not directly involve the use of any rules or models explicitly derived from data (bottom left of Figure). Suppose a new cardiovascular risk score is created that includes possible extensions to the original model. For example, it could be that risk factors should not be added but instead should be multiplied or divided, or perhaps a particularly important risk factor should square the entire score if it is present. Moreover, if it is not known in advance which variables will be important, but thousands of individual measurements have been collected, how should a good model be identified from among the infinite possibilities? This is precisely what a machine learning algorithm attempts to do. As humans impose fewer assumptions on the algorithm, it moves further up the machine learning spectrum. However, there is never a specific threshold wherein a model suddenly becomes \u201cmachine learning\u201d; rather, all of these approaches exist along a continuum, determined by how many human assumptions are placed onto the algorithm. An example of an approach high on the machine learning spectrum has recently emerged in the form of so-called deep learning models. Deep learning models are stunningly complex networks of artificial neurons that were designed expressly to create accurate models directly from raw data. Researchers recently demonstrated a deep learning algorithm capable of detecting diabetic retinopathy (#4 in the Figure, top center) from retinal photographs at a sensitivity equal to or greater than that of ophthalmologists.1 This model learned the diagnosis procedure directly from the raw pixels of the images with no human intervention outside of a team of ophthalmologists who annotated each image with the correct diagnosis. Because they are able to learn the task with little human instruction or prior assumptions, these deep learning algorithms rank very high on the machine learning spectrum (Figure, light blue circles). Though they require less human guidance, deep learning algorithms for image recognition require enormous amounts of data to capture the full complexity, variety, and nuance inherent to real-world images. Consequently, these algorithms often require hundreds of thousands of examples to extract the salient image features that are correlated with the outcome of interest. Higher placement on the machine learning spectrum does not imply superiority, because different tasks require different levels of human involvement. While algorithms high on the spectrum are often very flexible and can learn many tasks, they are often uninterpretable VIEWPOINT", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 3, "citationCount": 789, "influentialCitationCount": 10, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "143649421", "name": "Andrew Beam"}, {"authorId": "1740538", "name": "I.

However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our \u2018big data\u2019 world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents.

To deal with these challenges, the contribution of this paper includes the adoption of a hybrid approach that involves a sentiment analyzer that includes machine learning.

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 1800, "influentialCitationCount": 24, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2077989", "name": "R.

Regardless of successful applications of machine learning algorithms in many scenarios, e.g., facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection, these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable to a variety of security threats, inducing a significant performance decrease. Hence, it is vital to call for further attention regarding security threats and corresponding defensive techniques of machine learning, which motivates a comprehensive survey in this paper. Until now, researchers from academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks. Thus, we revisit existing security threats and give a systematic survey on them from two aspects, the training phase and the testing/inferring phase. After that, we categorize current defensive techniques of machine learning into four groups: security assessment mechanisms, countermeasures in the training phase, those in the testing or inferring phase, data security, and privacy. Finally, we provide five notable trends in the research on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning, which are worth doing in-depth studies in future.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 109, "citationCount": 243, "influentialCitationCount": 20, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48873711", "name": "Qiang Liu"}, {"authorId": "2112519091", "name": "Pan Li"}, {"authorId": "1681475", "name": "Wentao Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2089568220", "name": "Wei Cai"}, {"authorId": "144958145", "name": "Shui Yu"}, {"authorId": "143698682", "name": "Victor C.

The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web.
