This paper proposes a portable and automatic compiler-based approach to mapping such parallelism using machine learning. It develops two predictors: a data sensitive and a data insensitive predictor to select the best mapping for parallel programs. They predict the number of threads and the scheduling policy for any given program using a model learnt off-line. By using low-cost profiling runs, they predict the mapping for a new unseen program across multiple input data sets. We evaluate our approach by selecting parallelism mapping configurations for OpenMP programs on two representative but different multi-core platforms (the Intel Xeon and the Cell processors). Performance of our technique is stable across programs and architectures. On average, it delivers above 96% performance of the maximum available on both platforms. It achieve, on average, a 37% (up to 17.5 times) performance improvement over the OpenMP runtime default scheme on the Cell platform.

In this review, we concentrate on the present status and future perspectives of SignalP, our neural network-based method for prediction of the most well-known sorting signal: the secretory signal peptide. We discuss the problems associated with the use of SignalP on genomic sequences, showing that signal peptide prediction will improve further if integrated with predictions of start codons and transmembrane helices. As a step towards this goal, a hidden Markov model version of SignalP has been developed, making it possible to discriminate between cleaved signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors. Furthermore, we show how SignalP can be used to characterize putative signal peptides from an archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii.

A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. \nTo address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as \"teachers\" for a \"student\" model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. \nCompared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs.

Furthermore, the optimization method of a support vector machine is quadratic programming, which is a well-studied and understood mathematical programming technique. Support vector machine simulations are carried out on nonlinear problems previously studied by other researchers using neural networks. This allows initial comparison against other techniques to determine the feasibility of using the proposed method for nonlinear detection. Results show that support vector machines perform as well as neural networks on the nonlinear problems investigated. A method is then proposed to introduce decision feedback processing to support vector machines to address the fact that intersymbol interference (ISI) data generates input vectors having temporal correlation, whereas a standard support vector machine assumes independent input vectors. Presenting the problem from the viewpoint of the pattern space illustrates the utility of a bank of support vector machines.

We discuss basic schemes of competitive vector quantization as well as the so-called neural gas approach and Kohonen's topology-preserving self-organizing map.

The main challenge is to devise representations of atomic systems that are at the same time complete and concise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed to predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has led to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into an input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract definition of chemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a bra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the connections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic systems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their chemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets, which can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the atom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth overlap of atomic positions power spectrum, but also in real space, corresponding to n-body correlations of the atom density. This formalism lays the foundations for a more systematic tuning of the behavior of the representations, by introducing operators that represent the correlations between structure, composition, and the target properties.

We used machine learning to develop a model to calculate risk of hospital-based intervention or death in patients with UGIB and compared its performance with other scoring systems.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data collected from consecutive unselected patients with UGIB from medical centers in 4 countries (United States, Scotland, England, Denmark; n=1958) from March 2014 through March 2015. We used the data to derive and internally validate a gradient-boosting machine learning model to identify patients who met a composite endpoint of hospital-based intervention (transfusion or hemostatic intervention) or death within 30 days. We compared the performance of the machine learning prediction model with validated pre-endoscopic clinical risk scoring systems (the Glasgow-Blatchford score [GBS], admission-Rockall score, and AIMS65). We externally validated the machine learning model using data from 2 Asia-Pacific sites (Singapore and New Zealand; n=399). Performance was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe machine learning model identified patients who met the composite endpoint with an AUC of 0.91 in the in the internal validation set; the clinical scoring systems identified patients who met the composite endpoint with AUC values of 0.88 for GBS (P=.001), 0.73 for Rockall score (P<.001), and 0.78 for AIMS65 score (P<.001). In the external validation cohort, the machine learning model identified patients who met the composite endpoint with an AUC of 0.90, the GBS with an AUC of 0.87 (P=.004), the Rockall score with an AUC of 0.66 (P<.001), and the AIMS65 with an AUC of 0.64 (P<.001). At cutoff scores at which the machine learning model and GBS identified patients who met the composite endpoint with 100% sensitivity, the specificity values were 26% with the machine learning model vs 12% with GBS (P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed a machine learning model that identifies patients with UGIB who met a composite endpoint of hospital-based intervention or death within 30 days with a greater AUC and higher levels of specificity, at 100% sensitivity, than validated clinical risk scoring systems.

Our results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus, beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending neural-network-based wave function representations closer to the state-of-the-art in machine learning.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount": 124, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "152754428", "name": "Yoav Levine"}, {"authorId": "3074811", "name": "Or Sharir"}, {"authorId": "32289606", "name": "Nadav Cohen"}, {"authorId": "3140335", "name": "A.

A natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal spin configurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where these quantities are most difficult to approximate. Interestingly, after training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially depends only on the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of the network, and not on other model details such as network depth or model type.

Our methods automatically learn different types of wheel defects and predict during normal operation if a wheel has a defect or not. The first method is based on novel features for classifying time series data and it is used for classification with a support vector machine. To evaluate the performance of our method we construct multiple data sets for the following defect types: flat spot, shelling, and non-roundness. We outperform classical defect detection methods for flat spots and demonstrate prediction for the other two defect types for the first time. Motivated by the recent success of artificial neural networks for image classification, we train custom artificial neural networks with convolutional layers on 2-D representations of the measurement time series.

How can human interaction play a role in enabling users to efficiently create useful machine learning systems, in enabling successful application of algorithms by machine learning novices, and in ultimately making it possible in practice to apply machine learning to new problems? \nThe scope of the research presented here is the application of supervised learning algorithms to contemporary computer music composition and performance. Computer music is a domain rich with computational problems requiring the modeling of complex phenomena, the construction of real-time interactive systems, and the support of human creativity. Though varied, many of these problems may be addressed using machine learning techniques, including supervised learning in particular. This work endeavors to gain a deeper knowledge of the human factors surrounding the application of supervised learning to these types of problems, to make supervised learning algorithms more usable by musicians, and to study how supervised learning can function as a creative tool. \nThis thesis presents a general-purpose software system for applying standard supervised learning algorithms in music and other real-time problem domains. This system, called the Wekinator, supports human interaction throughout the entire supervised learning process, including the generation of training examples and the application of trained models to real-time inputs. The Wekinator is published as a freely-available, open source software project, and several composers have already employed it in the creation of new musical instruments and compositions. \nThis thesis also presents work utilizing the Wekinator to study human-computer interaction with supervised learning in computer music. Research is presented which includes a participatory design process with practicing composers, pedagogical use with non-expert users in an undergraduate classroom, a study of the design of a gesture recognition system for a sensor-augmented cello bow, and case studies with three composers who have used the system in completed artistic works. \nThe primary contributions of this work include (1) a new software tool allowing real-time human interaction with supervised learning algorithms, which includes a novel \u201cplayalong\u201d interaction for generating training data in real-time; (2) a demonstration of the important roles that interaction|encompassing both human-computer control and computer-human feedback|can play in the development of supervised learning systems, and a greater understanding of the differences between interactive and conventional machine learning contexts; (3) a better understanding of the requirements and challenges in the analysis and design of algorithms and interfaces for interactive supervised learning in real-time and creative problem domains; (4) a clearer characterization of composers' goals and priorities for interacting with computers in music composition and instrument design; and (5) a demonstration of the usefulness of interactive supervised learning as a creativity support tool.

For the case of neural network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based on these sums. We demonstrate empirically that this method produces similar results to the baseline. Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies. Combining these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to the published Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task, while using very little auxiliary storage in the optimizer.

As yet, however, the Pearl Causal Model (PCM) has had a lesser impact on economics or econometrics than on other disciplines. This may be due in part to the fact that the PCM is not as well suited to analyzing structures that exhibit features of central interest to economists and econometricians: optimization, equilibrium, and learning. We offer the settable systems framework as an extension of the PCM that permits causal discourse in systems embodying optimization, equilibrium, and learning. Because these are common features of physical, natural, or social systems, our framework may prove generally useful for machine learning. Important features distinguishing the settable system framework from the PCM are its countable dimensionality and the use of partitioning and partition-specific response functions to accommodate the behavior of optimizing and interacting agents and to eliminate the requirement of a unique fixed point for the system. Refinements of the PCM include the settable systems treatment of attributes, the causal role of exogenous variables, and the dual role of variables as causes and responses. A series of closely related machine learning examples and examples from game theory and machine learning with feedback demonstrates some limitations of the PCM and motivates the distinguishing features of settable systems.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 55, "citationCount": 65, "influentialCitationCount": 4, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2149702798", "name": "H.

This thesis focuses on the problems of collaborative prediction with non-random missing data and classification with missing features. We begin by presenting and elaborating on the theory of missing data due to Little and Rubin. We place a particular emphasis on the missing at random assumption in the multivariate setting with arbitrary patterns of missing data. We derive inference and prediction methods in the presence of random missing data for a variety of probabilistic models including finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixture models, and factor analysis. \nBased on this foundation, we develop several novel models and inference procedures for both the collaborative prediction problem and the problem of classification with missing features. We develop models and methods for collaborative prediction with non-random missing data by combining standard models for complete data with models of the missing data process. Using a novel recommender system data set and experimental protocol, we show that each proposed method achieves a substantial increase in rating prediction performance compared to models that assume missing ratings are missing at random. \nWe describe several strategies for classification with missing features including the use of generative classifiers, and the combination of standard discriminative classifiers with single imputation, multiple imputation, classification in subspaces, and an approach based on modifying the classifier input representation to include response indicators.

Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.

In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a nonnegligible portion of participants (estimated 1530) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes.

Generally, ML tools learn from data to find insights or make fast predictions of target properties. Recently, ML is also greatly influencing heterogeneous catalysis research due to the availability of ML (e.g., Python Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and workflow management tools (e.g., ASE, Atomate), the growing amount of data in materials databases (e.g., Novel Materials Discovery Laboratory, Citrination, Materials Project, CatApp), and algorithmic improvements. New catalysts are needed for sustainable chemical production, alternative energy, and pollution mitigation applications to meet the demands of our world\u2019s rising population. It is a challenging endeavor, however, to make novel heterogeneous catalysts with good performance (i.e., stable, active, selective) because their performance depends on many properties: composition, support, surface termination, particle size, particle morphology, and atomic coordination environment. Additionally, the properties of heterogeneous catalysts can change under reaction conditions through various phenomena such as Ostwald ripening, particle disintegration, surface oxidation, and surface reconstruction. Many heterogeneous catalyst structures are disordered or amorphous in their active state, which further complicates their atomic-level characterization by modeling and experiment. Computational modeling using quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as density functional theory (DFT) can accelerate catalyst screening by enabling rapid prototyping and revealing active sites and structure-activity relations. The high computational cost of QM methods, however, limits the range of catalyst spaces that can be examined. Recent progress in merging ML with QM modeling and experiments promises to drive forward rational catalyst design. Therefore, it is timely to highlight the ability of ML tools to accelerate heterogeneous catalyst research. A key question we aim to address in this perspective is how machine learning can aid heterogeneous catalyst design and discovery. ML has been used in catalysis research since at least the 1990s. Early studies used neural networks to correlate catalyst physicochemical properties and reaction conditions with measured catalytic performance, but these studies were limited in the number of systems considered. Recently, ML has been applied to the high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and found to be predictive and applicable across a broad space of catalysts. ML algorithms such as decision trees, kernel ridge regression, neural networks, support vector machines, principal component analysis, and compressed sensing can help create predictive models of catalyst target properties, which are typically figures of merit corresponding to stability, activity, selectivity. In this perspective, we discuss various areas where ML is making an impact on heterogeneous catalysis research. ML is also aiding homogeneous catalysis research and shares many similarities (and differences) with ML for heterogeneous catalysis, but this discussion is beyond the perspective\u2019s scope (for interested readers, see Ref. 26\u201328). Here, we emphasize the ability of ML combined with QM calculations to speed-up the search for optimal catalysts in combinatorial large spaces, such as alloys. ML-derived interatomic potentials for accurate and fast catalyst simulations will also be assessed, as well as the opportunity for ML to help find descriptors of catalyst performance in large datasets.

Biological and chemical databases are increasingly being populated with linkages between protein sequences and chemical structures. There is now sufficient information to apply machine-learning techniques to predict interactions between chemicals and proteins at a genome scale. Current machine-learning techniques use as input either protein sequences and structures or chemical information. We propose here a method to infer protein-chemical interactions using heterogeneous input consisting of both protein sequence and chemical information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur method relies on expressing proteins and chemicals with a common cheminformatics representation. We demonstrate our approach by predicting whether proteins can catalyze reactions not present in training sets. We also predict whether a given drug can bind a target, in the absence of prior binding information for that drug and target. Such predictions cannot be made with current machine-learning techniques requiring binding information for individual reactions or individual targets.", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 40, "citationCount": 152, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6324301", "name": "J.

Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Jason Gross, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology Abstract People can learn visual concepts from just one example, but it remains a mystery how this is accomplished. Many authors have proposed that transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One hypothesis is that the shar- ing of parts is core to one shot learning, and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters, using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a rich inter- nal part structure, yet they are particularly tractable for com- putational models. We introduce a generative model of how characters are composed from strokes, where knowledge from previous characters helps to infer the latent strokes in novel characters. The stroke model outperforms a competing state- of-the-art character model on a challenging one shot learning task, and it provides a good fit to human perceptual data. Keywords: category learning; transfer learning; Bayesian modeling; neural networks Figure 1: Test yourself on one shot learning. From the example boxed in red, can you find the others in the array? On the left is a Segway and on the right is the first character of the Bengali alphabet. Answer for the Bengali character: Row 2, Column 3; Row 4, Column 2. A hallmark of human cognition is learning from just a few examples. For instance, a person only needs to see one Seg- way to acquire the concept and be able to discriminate future Segways from other vehicles like scooters and unicycles (Fig. 1 left). Similarly, children can acquire a new word from one encounter (Carey & Bartlett, 1978). How is one shot learning possible? New concepts are almost never learned in a vacuum. Past experience with other concepts in a domain can support the rapid learning of novel concepts, by showing the learner what matters for generalization. Many authors have suggested this as a route to one shot learning: transfer of abstract knowledge from old to new concepts, often called transfer learning, rep- resentation learning, or learning to learn. But what is the nature of the learned abstract knowledge that lets humans ac- quire new object concepts so quickly? The most straightforward proposals invoke attentional learning (Smith, Jones, Landau, Gershkoff-Stowe, & Samuel- son, 2002) or overhypotheses (Kemp, Perfors, & Tenenbaum, 2007; Dewar & Xu, in press), like the shape bias in word learning. Prior experience with concepts that are clearly orga- nized along one dimension (e.g., shape, as opposed to color or material) draws a learner\u2019s attention to that same dimension (Smith et al., 2002) \u2013 or increases the prior probability of new concepts concentrating on that same dimension (Kemp et al., 2007). But this approach is limited since it requires that the relevant dimensions of similarity be defined in advance. For many real-world concepts, the relevant dimensions of similarity may be constructed in the course of learning to learn. For instance, when we first see a Segway, we may parse it into a structure of familiar parts arranged in a novel configuration: it has two wheels, connected by a platform, supporting a motor and a central post at the top of which are two handlebars. These parts and their relations comprise a Figure 2: Examples from a new 1600 character database. useful representational basis for many different vehicle and artifact concepts \u2013 a representation that is likely learned in the course of learning the concepts that they support. Several papers from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature argue for such an approach: joint learning of many concepts and a high-level part vocabulary that underlies those concepts (e.g., Torralba, Murphy, & Freeman, 2007; Fei-Fei, Fergus, & Perona, 2006). Another recently popular machine learning approach is based on deep learning (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009): unsupervised learning of hierarchies of dis- tributed feature representations in neural-network-style prob- abilistic generative models. These models do not specify ex- plicit parts and structural relations, but they can still construct meaningful representations of what makes two objects deeply similar that go substantially beyond low-level image features. These approaches from machine learning may be com- pelling ways to understand how humans learn so quickly, but there is little experimental evidence that directly supports them. Models that construct parts or features from sensory data (pixels) while learning object concepts have been tested in elegant behavioral experiments with very simple stimuli and a very small number of concepts (Austerweil & Griffiths, 2009; Schyns, Goldstone, & Thibaut, 1998). But there have been few systematic comparisons of multiple state-of-the-art computational approaches to representation learning with hu-", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 20, "citationCount": 674, "influentialCitationCount": 101, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2373318", "name": "B.

Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on the problem recently and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, existing approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings. Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting SVM, Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include PRank, OC SVM, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, LambdaRank, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed.

Initialisation of the proposed approach is done by extracting the three-phase current signals at the targeted buses of different feeders. The obtained non-stationary signals are passed through the empirical mode decomposition method to extract different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). In the next step using HHT to the selected IMFs component, different needful differential features are computed. The extracted features are further used as an input vector to the machine learning models to classify the fault events. The proposed micro-grid protection scheme is tested for different protection scenarios, such as the type of fault (symmetrical, asymmetrical and high impedance fault), micro-grid structure (radial and mesh) and mode of operation (islanded and grid connected) and so on. Three different machine learning models are tested and compared in this framework: Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machine and extreme learning machine. The extensive simulated results from a standard IEC micro-grid model prove the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed micro-grid protection scheme.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount": 114, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "9736746", "name": "Manohar Mishra"}, {"authorId": "34851668", "name": "P.

Most approaches emphasize choices of features and classifiers. They neglect individual differences in target persons. People vary markedly in facial morphology (e.g., heavy versus delicate brows, smooth versus deeply etched wrinkles) and behavior. Individual differences can dramatically influence how well generic classifiers generalize to previously unseen persons. While a possible solution would be to train person-specific classifiers, that often is neither feasible nor theoretically compelling. The alternative that we propose is to personalize a generic classifier in an unsupervised manner (no additional labels for the test subjects are required). We introduce a transductive learning method, which we refer to Selective Transfer Machine (STM), to personalize a generic classifier by attenuating person-specific biases. STM achieves this effect by simultaneously learning a classifier and re-weighting the training samples that are most relevant to the test subject. To evaluate the effectiveness of STM, we compared STM to generic classifiers and to cross-domain learning methods in three major databases: CK+, GEMEP-FERA and RU-FACS.
