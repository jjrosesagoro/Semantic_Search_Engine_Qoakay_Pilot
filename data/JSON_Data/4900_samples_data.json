Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length (either due to brief recordings or previous trajectory segmentation) and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate single trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with high accuracy. In addition, the algorithm is able to determine the anomalous exponent with a small error, thus inherently providing a classification of the motion as normal or anomalous (sub- or super-diffusion). The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/test dataset.

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms.

The rates of unplanned readmission are, therefore, regarded as an important performance indicator for the medical quality of a hospital and healthcare system. Identifying high-risk patients likely to suffer from readmission before release benefits both the patients and the medical providers. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to develop efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians. Methods and Findings We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate) that are significant in time series with temporal dependencies, which cannot be properly captured by traditional static models, but can be captured by our proposed deep neural network based model. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD9 embeddings. Our machine learning models identifies ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate (0.742) and an improved Area Under the Curve (0.791) compared with traditional methods. We also illustrate the importance of each portion of the features and different combinations of the models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Conclusion Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision making accuracy, and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven results enable clinicians to make assisted decisions within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for hospitals by improving the detection of possible readmission.

In this paradigm, the user data never leaves the client, greatly enhancing the user' privacy, in contrast to the traditional paradigm of collecting, storing and processing user data on a backend server beyond the user's control. In this paper we introduce, as far as we are aware, the first federated implementation of a Collaborative Filter. The federated updates to the model are based on a stochastic gradient approach. As a classical case study in machine learning, we explore a personalized recommendation system based on users' implicit feedback and demonstrate the method's applicability to both the MovieLens and an in-house dataset.

Especially when classification is to be performed over many categories, providing enough training samples for each category is infeasible. This paper describes new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with little loss in accuracy.

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL/sup 3/)/sup l/ for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L/sup 2/) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L/sup 3/) for general state estimation and O(L/sup 2/) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L/sup 3/)).

Using double layer of parallelization, DiSMEC can learn classifiers for datasets consisting hundreds of thousands labels within few hours. The explicit capacity control mechanism filters out spurious parameters which keep the model compact in size, without losing prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on publicly available real-world datasets consisting upto 670,000 labels. We compare DiSMEC with recent state-of-the-art approaches, including - SLEEC which is a leading approach for learning sparse local embeddings, and FastXML which is a tree-based approach optimizing ranking based loss function.

For the past four decades, human decision-making under uncertainty has continued to be explained by theoretical models based on prospect theory, a framework that was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. However, theoretical models of this kind have developed slowly, and robust, high-precision predictive models of human decisions remain a challenge. While machine learning is a natural candidate for solving these problems, it is currently unclear to what extent it can improve predictions obtained by current theories. We argue that this is mainly due to data scarcity, since noisy human behavior requires massive sample sizes to be accurately captured by off-the-shelf machine learning methods. To solve this problem, what is needed are machine learning models with appropriate inductive biases for capturing human behavior, and larger datasets. We offer two contributions towards this end: first, we construct \"cognitive model priors\" by pretraining neural networks with synthetic data generated by cognitive models (i.e., theoretical models developed by cognitive psychologists). We find that fine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results in unprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second, we present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing over 240,000 human judgments across over 13,000 decision problems. This dataset reveals the circumstances where cognitive model priors are useful, and provides a new standard for benchmarking prediction of human decisions under uncertainty.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 27, "citationCount": 45, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145423354", "name": "David D.

Speaking to someone over the telephone usually begins by identifying who is speaking and, at least in cases of familiar speakers, a subjective verification by the listener that the identity is correct and the conversation can proceed. Automatic speaker-recognition systems have emerged as an important means of verifying identity in many e-commerce applications as well as in general business interactions, forensics, and law enforcement. Human experts trained in forensic speaker recognition can perform this task even better by examining a set of acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic characteristics of speech in a general approach referred to as structured listening. Techniques in forensic speaker recognition have been developed for many years by forensic speech scientists and linguists to help reduce any potential bias or preconceived understanding as to the validity of an unknown audio sample and a reference template from a potential suspect. Experienced researchers in signal processing and machine learning continue to develop automatic algorithms to effectively perform speaker recognition?with ever-improving performance?to the point where automatic systems start to perform on par with human listeners. In this article, we review the literature on speaker recognition by machines and humans, with an emphasis on prominent speaker-modeling techniques that have emerged in the last decade for automatic systems. We discuss different aspects of automatic systems, including voice-activity detection (VAD), features, speaker models, standard evaluation data sets, and performance metrics. Human speaker recognition is discussed in two parts?the first part involves forensic speaker-recognition methods, and the second illustrates how a na?ve listener performs this task from a neuroscience perspective.

How can we get a machine to learn language? It first presents an explicit computational model of language acquisition which can actually learn rules of English syntax given a sequence of grammatical, but otherwise unprepared, sentences.It shows that natural languages are designed to be easily learned and easily processed-an exciting breakthrough from the point of view of artificial intelligence and the design of expert systems because it shows how extensive knowledge might be acquired automatically, without outside intervention. Computationally, the book demonstrates how constraints that may be reasonably assumed to aid sentence processing also aid language acquisition.Chapters in the book's second part apply computational methods to the general problem of developmental growth, particularly the thorny problem of the interaction between innate genetic endowment and environmental input, with the intent of uncovering the constraints on the acquisition of syntactic knowledge. A number of \"mini-theories\" of learning are incorporated in this study of syntax with results that should appeal to a wide range of scholarly interests. These include how lexical categories, phonological rule systems, and phrase structure rules are learned; the role of semantic-syntactic interaction in language acquisition; how a \"parameter setting\" model may be formalized as a learning procedure; how multiple constraints (from syntax, thematic knowledge, or phrase structure) interact to aid acquisition; how transformational-type rules may be learned; and, the role of lexical ambiguity in language acquisition.Robert Berwick is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.

Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form.

Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms.

Using profile-driven parallelism detection we overcome the limitations of static analysis, enabling us to identify more application parallelism and only rely on the user for final approval. In addition, we replace the traditional target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics with a machine-learning based prediction mechanism, resulting in better mapping decisions while providing more scope for adaptation to different target architectures. We have evaluated our parallelization strategy against the NAS and SPEC OMP benchmarks and two different multi-core platforms (dual quad-core Intel Xeon SMP and dual-socket QS20 Cell blade). We demonstrate that our approach not only yields significant improvements when compared with state-of-the-art parallelizing compilers, but comes close to and sometimes exceeds the performance of manually parallelized codes.

In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Specifically, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the specific data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned filters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW).

Experimental Design: Overall, 334 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and 101 patients with benign ovarian tumors were randomly assigned to \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d cohorts. Seven supervised machine learning classifiers, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), Conditional RF (CRF), Na\u00efve Bayes, Neural Network, and Elastic Net, were used to derive diagnostic and prognostic information from 32 parameters commonly available from pretreatment peripheral blood tests and age. Results: Machine learning techniques were superior to conventional regression-based analyses in predicting multiple clinical parameters pertaining to EOC. Ensemble methods combining weak decision trees, such as GBM, RF, and CRF, showed the best performance in EOC prediction. The values for the highest accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for segregating EOC from benign ovarian tumors with RF were 92.4% and 0.968, respectively. The highest accuracy and AUC for predicting clinical stages with RF were 69.0% and 0.760, respectively. High-grade serous and mucinous histotypes of EOC could be preoperatively predicted with RF. An ordinal RF classifier could distinguish complete resection from others. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified subgroups among early-stage EOC patients with significantly worse survival.

Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitative insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.", "year": 1998, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount": 194, "influentialCitationCount": 14, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1763295", "name": "J.
