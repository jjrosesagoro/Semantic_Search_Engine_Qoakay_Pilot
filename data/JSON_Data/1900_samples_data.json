Everyday people who need to teach their machines new things will find it natural for to rely on their interpersonal interaction skills. This thesis provides several contributions towards the understanding of this Socially Guided Machine Learning scenario. \nWhile the topic of human input to machine learning algorithms has been explored to some extent, prior works have not gone far enough to understand what people will try to communicate when teaching a machine and how algorithms and learning systems can be modified to better accommodate a human partner. Interface techniques have been based on intuition and assumptions rather than grounded in human behavior, and often techniques are not demonstrated or evaluated with everyday people. \nUsing a computer game, Sophie's Kitchen, an experiment with human subjects provides several insights about how people approach the task of teaching a machine. In particular, people want to direct and guide an agent's exploration process, they quickly use the behavior of the agent to infer a mental model of the learning process, and they utilize positive and negative feedback in asymmetric ways. Using a robotic platform, Leonardo, and 200 people in follow-up studies of modified versions of the Sophie's Kitchen game, four research themes are developed. \nThe use of human guidance in a machine learning exploration can be successfully incorporated to improve learning performance. Novel learning approaches demonstrate aspects of goal-oriented learning. The transparency of the machine learner can have significant effects on the nature of the instruction received from the human teacher, which in turn positively impacts the learning process. Utilizing asymmetric interpretations of positive and negative feedback from a human partner, can result in a more efficient and robust learning experience.

This dataset can be used to evaluate the developed algorithms, reproduce the results, set benchmarks, and compare the different solutions. In this work, we introduce the DeepMIMO dataset, which is a generic dataset for mmWave/massive MIMO channels. The DeepMIMO dataset generation framework has two important features. First, the DeepMIMO channels are constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data obtained from Remcom Wireless InSite. The DeepMIMO channels, therefore, capture the dependence on the environment geometry/materials and transmitter/receiver locations, which is essential for several machine learning applications. Second, the DeepMIMO dataset is generic/parameterized as the researcher can adjust a set of system and channel parameters to tailor the generated DeepMIMO dataset for the target machine learning application. The DeepMIMO dataset can then be completely defined by the (i) the adopted ray-tracing scenario and (ii) the set of parameters, which enables the accurate definition and reproduction of the dataset.

More unsupervised clustering of tasks is obtained if we go from a single Gaussian prior to a mixture of Gaussians.

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount": 422, "influentialCitationCount": 32, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Physics", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1398105826", "name": "Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez"}, {"authorId": "2069002234", "name": "Jonathan Godwin"}, {"authorId": "2054956", "name": "T.

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data.", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 68, "citationCount": 1789, "influentialCitationCount": 104, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145602732", "name": "Kobus Barnard"}, {"authorId": "2446509", "name": "P.

For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition).

It is proved in theory that ELM can be extended to single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with radial basis function (RBF) kernels RBF networks, which allows the centers and impact widths of RBF kernels to be randomly generated and the output weights to be simply analytically calculated instead of iteratively tuned.

Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness.

We present an efficient algorithm that learns structural information about data from positive examples alone.

The wrapper verification system detects when a wrapper is not extracting correct data, usually because the Web source has changed its format. The reinduction algorithm automatically recovers from changes in the Web source by identifying data on Web pages so that a new wrapper may be generated for this source. To validate our approach, we monitored 27 wrappers over a period of a year. The verification algorithm correctly discovered 35 of the 37 wrapper changes, and made 16 mistakes, resulting in precision of 0.73 and recall of 0.95.

One of the challenges in applying these techniques for classifying gene expression data is to extract accurate, readily interpretable rules providing biological insight as to how classification is performed. Current methods generate classifiers that are accurate but difficult to interpret. This is the trade-off between credibility and comprehensibility of the classifiers. Here, we introduce a new classifier in order to address these problems. It is referred to as k-TSP (k-Top Scoring Pairs) and is based on the concept of 'relative expression reversals'. This method generates simple and accurate decision rules that only involve a small number of gene-to-gene expression comparisons, thereby facilitating follow-up studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we have compared our approach to other machine learning techniques for class prediction in 19 binary and multi-class gene expression datasets involving human cancers. The k-TSP classifier performs as efficiently as Prediction Analysis of Microarray and support vector machine, and outperforms other learning methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbour and na\u00efve Bayes). Our approach is easy to interpret as the classifier involves only a small number of informative genes. For these reasons, we consider the k-TSP method to be a useful tool for cancer classification from microarray gene expression data.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe software and datasets are available at http://www.ccbm.jhu.edu\n\n\nCONTACT\nactan@jhu.edu.", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount": 391, "influentialCitationCount": 35, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144665015", "name": "A.

We consider two attack models: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data corruption and a restrained attack model that anticipates more realistic attacks that a reasonable adversary would devise under penalties. We then develop optimal SVM learning strategies against the two attack models. The learning algorithms minimize the hinge loss while assuming the adversary is modifying data to maximize the loss.

In the pneumonia risk prediction case study, the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had prevented complex learned models from being fielded in this domain, but because it is intelligible and modular allows these patterns to be recognized and removed. In the 30-day hospital readmission case study, we show that the same methods scale to large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of patients and thousands of attributes while remaining intelligible and providing accuracy comparable to the best (unintelligible) machine learning methods.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 7, "citationCount": 1087, "influentialCitationCount": 55, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145727186", "name": "R.
