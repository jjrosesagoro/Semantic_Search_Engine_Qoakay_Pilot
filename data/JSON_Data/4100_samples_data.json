Due to the advances of powerful feature representations, machine-learning-based object detection is receiving increasing attention. Although numerous feature representations exist, most of them are handcrafted or shallow-learning-based features. As the object detection task becomes more challenging, their description capability becomes limited or even impoverished. More recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown their much stronger feature representation power in computer vision. Despite the progress made in nature scene images, it is problematic to directly use the CNN feature for object detection in optical remote sensing images because it is difficult to effectively deal with the problem of object rotation variations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to learn a rotation-invariant CNN (RICNN) model for advancing the performance of object detection, which is achieved by introducing and learning a new rotation-invariant layer on the basis of the existing CNN architectures. However, different from the training of traditional CNN models that only optimizes the multinomial logistic regression objective, our RICNN model is trained by optimizing a new objective function via imposing a regularization constraint, which explicitly enforces the feature representations of the training samples before and after rotating to be mapped close to each other, hence achieving rotation invariance. To facilitate training, we first train the rotation-invariant layer and then domain-specifically fine-tune the whole RICNN network to further boost the performance.

High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the considered drugs. Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R2 of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC50 values rather than experimentally measuring them. The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount": 361, "influentialCitationCount": 10, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "143817725", "name": "M.

This type of representation is a natural fit for a number of real-world learning scenarios, including drug activity prediction and image classification, hence many MI learning algorithms have been proposed. Any MI learning method must relate instances to bag-level class labels, but many types of relationships between instances and class labels are possible. Although all early work in MI learning assumes a specific MI concept class known to be appropriate for a drug activity prediction domain; this \u2018standard MI assumption\u2019 is not guaranteed to hold in other domains. Much of the recent work in MI learning has concentrated on a relaxed view of the MI problem, where the standard MI assumption is dropped, and alternative assumptions are considered instead.

Machine learning, a data-driven approach, has become popular during the past decades and is useful for solving such inverse problems. An advantage of machine learning methods is that they can be implemented without knowledge of physical equations or theories. The challenges of machine learning lie in acquiring enough training data and selecting relevant parameters, which are essential in obtaining a good quality model. In this study, we compare geophysical inversion and machine learning approaches in solving inverse problems and show similarities and differences of these approaches in a mathematical form and numerical tests. Both methods aid in solving ill-posed and nonlinear problems and use similar optimization techniques. We take reflectivity inversion as an example of the inverse problem. We apply geophysical inversion based on the least-squares method and artificial neural networks as a machine learning approach to solve reflectivity inversion using 2D synthetic data sets and 3D field data sets. A neural network with multiple hidden layers successfully generates the nonlinear mapping function to predict reflectivity. For this inverse problem, we test different L1 regularizers for both approaches.

First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges.

Two classical optimization problems, graph partitioning and boolean satisfiability, and a deep belief network application are mapped onto the proposed hardware. As compared to a multicore system, the proposed accelerator achieves 57x higher performance and 25x lower energy with virtually no loss in the quality of the solution to the optimization problems.

The prognostications of hardware enumerated in wanton fantasy have been achieved and even superseded in the actual Architecture Machine of 1972.\"The general assumption of this new book is that the architect is an unnecessary and even detrimental middleman between individual, continuously changing needs and the continuous incorporation of those needs into the built environment. The book proposes a new kind of architecture without architects, and even without surrogate architects.The first chapter sets forth generally what is involved in learning to understand both the makings of intelligence and the making of architecture. It reveals polarities in attitudes toward thinking about thinking, and it appraises techniques--real and potential--that lead to meaningful thought about the process.A more direct analysis of architectural design activities is presented in the second chapter. Its goal is to achieve a closer coupling between man and machine, and it proposes sidestepping the traditional division of labor in which man and machine are assigned tasks that they are supposed to be respectively better at. Instead, a joint venture model is suggested: man and machine are treated as equal partners, even as candid good friends.The third chapter moves beyond the architect--beyond the need for an outside designer's intervention between our needs and their fulfillment. It asserts that each individual can be the best architect for his own needs and does not require a paternalistic human or mechanical architect to dictate his final decisions.The last chapter--furthest out of all--looks toward a distant future not only beyond the architect but beyond architecture as we know it. Here architecture machines are not simply used as aids in the design of buildings--they serve as buildings in themselves.

In many settings, considerable work is required to make standard machine-learning methods useful for specific scientific applications. We find, however, that in the case of treatment effect estimation with randomized experiments, regression adjustments via machine-learning methods designed to minimize test set error directly induce efficient estimates of the average treatment effect. Thus, machine-learning methods can be used out of the box for this task, without any special-case adjustments. We study the problem of treatment effect estimation in randomized experiments with high-dimensional covariate information and show that essentially any risk-consistent regression adjustment can be used to obtain efficient estimates of the average treatment effect. Our results considerably extend the range of settings where high-dimensional regression adjustments are guaranteed to provide valid inference about the population average treatment effect. We then propose cross-estimation, a simple method for obtaining finite-sample\u2013unbiased treatment effect estimates that leverages high-dimensional regression adjustments. Our method can be used when the regression model is estimated using the lasso, the elastic net, subset selection, etc. Finally, we extend our analysis to allow for adaptive specification search via cross-validation and flexible nonparametric regression adjustments with machine-learning methods such as random forests or neural networks.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 84, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3160667", "name": "Stefan Wager"}, {"authorId": "24091672", "name": "Wenfei Du"}, {"authorId": "2110315433", "name": "Jonathan E.

Yet knowing their performance characteristics --- their runtimes and resource usage --- can solve two important problems. First, every database vendor struggles with managing unexpectedly long-running queries. When these long-running queries can be identified before they start, they can be rejected or scheduled when they will not cause extreme resource contention for the other queries in the system. Second, deciding whether a system can complete a given workload in a given time period (or a bigger system is necessary) depends on knowing the resource requirements of the queries in that workload. We have developed a system that uses machine learning to accurately predict the performance metrics of database queries whose execution times range from milliseconds to hours. For training and testing our system, we used both real customer queries and queries generated from an extended set of TPC-DS templates. The extensions mimic queries that caused customer problems. We used these queries to compare how accurately different techniques predict metrics such as elapsed time, records used, disk I/Os, and message bytes. The most promising technique was not only the most accurate, but also predicted these metrics simultaneously and using only information available prior to query execution. We validated the accuracy of this machine learning technique on a number of HP Neoview configurations.

In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third.

Recently, there has been a surge in machine learning society to develop algorithms for fair machine learning. In particular, several adversarial learning procedures have been proposed to impose fairness. Unfortunately, these algorithms either can only impose fairness up to linear dependence between the variables, or they lack computational convergence guarantees. In this paper, we use Renyi correlation as a measure of fairness of machine learning models and develop a general training framework to impose fairness. In particular, we propose a min-max formulation which balances the accuracy and fairness when solved to optimality. For the case of discrete sensitive attributes, we suggest an iterative algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee for solving the proposed min-max problem. Our algorithm and analysis are then specialized to fair classification and fair clustering problems. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed Renyi fair inference framework in practice, we compare it with well-known existing methods on several benchmark datasets.

Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closedform mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to introduce a random forests (RFs)-based prognostic method for tool wear prediction as well as compare the performance of RFs with feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) ANNs and SVR. Specifically, the performance of FFBP ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental data collected from 315 milling tests. Experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than FFBP ANNs with a single hidden layer and SVR.

Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are a computationally efficient way to identify phenotype-associated variables in high-dimensional data. There are important results from mathematical theory and numerous practical results documenting their value. One attractive feature of MLAs is that many operate in a fully multivariate environment, allowing for small-importance variables to be included when they act cooperatively. However, certain properties of MLAs under conditions common in genomic-related data have not been well-studied--in particular, correlations among predictors pose a problem.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing extensive simulation, we showed considering correlation within predictors is crucial in making valid inferences using variable importance measures (VIMs) from three MLAs: random forest (RF), conditional inference forest (CIF) and Monte Carlo logic regression (MCLR). Using a case-control illustration, we showed that the RF VIMs--even permutation-based--were less able to detect association than other algorithms at effect sizes encountered in complex disease studies. This reduction occurred when 'causal' predictors were correlated with other predictors, and was sharpest when RF tree building used the Gini index. Indeed, RF Gini VIMs are biased under correlation, dependent on predictor correlation strength/number and over-trained to random fluctuations in data when tree terminal node size was small. Permutation-based VIM distributions were less variable for correlated predictors and are unbiased, thus may be preferred when predictors are correlated.

Converging with this shift, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach in the literature that: 1) fuses facial expression, shoulder gesture, and audio cues for dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions in valence and arousal space, 2) compares the performance of two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques applied to the target problem, the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (BLSTM-NNs), and Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), and 3) proposes an output-associative fusion framework that incorporates correlations and covariances between the emotion dimensions. Evaluation of the proposed approach has been done using the spontaneous SAL data from four subjects and subject-dependent leave-one-sequence-out cross validation. The experimental results obtained show that: 1) on average, BLSTM-NNs outperform SVR due to their ability to learn past and future context, 2) the proposed output-associative fusion framework outperforms feature-level and model-level fusion by modeling and learning correlations and patterns between the valence and arousal dimensions, and 3) the proposed system is well able to reproduce the valence and arousal ground truth obtained from human coders.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 443, "influentialCitationCount": 33, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1752913", "name": "M.

However, an increasing number of scientists are going in the opposite direction by utilizing opaque machine learning models to make predictions and draw inferences, suggesting that scientists are opting for models that have less potential for understanding. Are scientists trading understanding for some other epistemic or pragmatic good when they choose a machine learning model? Or are the assumptions behind why minimal models provide understanding misguided? In this article, using the case of deep neural networks, I argue that it is not the complexity or black box nature of a model that limits how much understanding the model provides. Instead, it is a lack of scientific and empirical evidence supporting the link that connects a model to the target phenomenon that primarily prohibits understanding.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 81, "citationCount": 50, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49503692", "name": "E.

Discrimination-aware data mining studies how to make predictive models free from discrimination, when historical data, on which they are built, may be biased, incomplete, or even contain past discriminatory decisions. Discrimination refers to disadvantageous treatment of a person based on belonging to a category rather than on individual merit. In this survey we review and organize various discrimination measures that have been used for measuring discrimination in data, as well as in evaluating performance of discrimination-aware predictive models. We also discuss related measures from other disciplines, which have not been used for measuring discrimination, but potentially could be suitable for this purpose. We computationally analyze properties of selected measures. We also review and discuss measuring procedures, and present recommendations for practitioners. The primary target audience is data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, statistical modeling researchers developing new methods for non-discriminatory predictive modeling. In addition, practitioners and policy makers would use the survey for diagnosing potential discrimination by predictive models.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 128, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1740809", "name": "I. \u017dliobait\u0117"}]}, {"paperId": "34c062e2b8a3f6421b9f4ff22f115a36d4aba823", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/34c062e2b8a3f6421b9f4ff22f115a36d4aba823", "title": "A Dataset and a Technique for Generalized Nuclear Segmentation for Computational Pathology", "abstract": "Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high-quality features for nuclear morphometrics and other analysis in computational pathology. Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object- and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 469, "influentialCitationCount": 107, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2119734444", "name": "Neeraj Kumar"}, {"authorId": "3200813", "name": "R.

In most of the current training schemes the central model is refined by averaging the parameters of the server model and the updated parameters from the client side. However, directly averaging model parameters is only possible if all models have the same structure and size, which could be a restrictive constraint in many scenarios. \nIn this work we investigate more powerful and more flexible aggregation schemes for FL. Specifically, we propose ensemble distillation for model fusion, i.e. training the central classifier through unlabeled data on the outputs of the models from the clients. This knowledge distillation technique mitigates privacy risk and cost to the same extent as the baseline FL algorithms, but allows flexible aggregation over heterogeneous client models that can differ e.g. in size, numerical precision or structure. We show in extensive empirical experiments on various CV/NLP datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, AG News, SST2) and settings (heterogeneous models/data) that the server model can be trained much faster, requiring fewer communication rounds than any existing FL technique so far.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 86, "citationCount": 250, "influentialCitationCount": 52, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145724662", "name": "Tao Lin"}, {"authorId": "2069275317", "name": "Lingjing Kong"}, {"authorId": "2127057", "name": "Sebastian U.
