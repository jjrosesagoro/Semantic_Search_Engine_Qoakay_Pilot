An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies.

Behind this simple equation lies a revolution in the study of knowledge, which has left the halls of philosophy for the labs of science. This book offers a cogent account of what such a move does to our understanding of the nature of learning, rationality, and intelligence. Bringing together evolutionary biology, psychology, and philosophy, Henry Plotkin presents a new science of knowledge, one that traces an unbreakable link between instinct and our ability to know. Contrary to the modern liberal idea that knowledge is something derived from experience, this science shows us that what we know is what our nature allows us to know, what our instincts tell us we must know. Since our ability to know our world depends primarily on what we call intelligence, intelligence must be understood as an extension of instinct. Drawing on contemporary evolutionary theory, especially notions of hierarchical structure and universal Darwinism, Plotkin tells us that the capacity for knowledge, which is what makes us human, is deeply rooted in our biology and, in a special sense, is shared by all living things. This leads to a discussion of animal and human intelligence as well as an appraisal of what an instinct-based capacity for knowledge might mean to our understanding of language, reasoning, emotion, and culture. The result is nothing less than a three-dimensional theory of our nature, in which all knowledge is adaptation and all adaptation is a specific form of knowledge.", "year": 1994, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 252, "influentialCitationCount": 18, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology"], "authors": [{"authorId": "40429633", "name": "H.

Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible.

Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better.

The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one.

In standard trees, each node is split using the best split among all variables. In a random forest, each node is split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node. This somewhat counterintuitive strategy turns out to perform very well compared to many other classifiers, including discriminant analysis, support vector machines and neural networks, and is robust against overfitting (Breiman, 2001). In addition, it is very user-friendly in the sense that it has only two parameters (the number of variables in the random subset at each node and the number of trees in the forest), and is usually not very sensitive to their values.

Although subjective visual interpretation remains the clinical mainstay, quantitative analysis facilitates objective, evidence-based management, and advances in clinical research. This has driven developments in computing and software tools aimed at achieving fully automated image processing and quantitative analysis. In parallel, machine learning techniques have been used to rapidly integrate large amounts of clinical and quantitative imaging data to provide highly personalized individual patient-based conclusions. Areas covered: This review summarizes recent advances in automated quantitative imaging in cardiology and describes the latest techniques which incorporate machine learning principles. The review focuses on the cardiac imaging techniques which are in wide clinical use. It also discusses key issues and obstacles for these tools to become utilized in mainstream clinical practice. Expert commentary: Fully-automated processing and high-level computer interpretation of cardiac imaging are becoming a reality. Application of machine learning to the vast amounts of quantitative data generated per scan and integration with clinical data also facilitates a move to more patient-specific interpretation. These developments are unlikely to replace interpreting physicians but will provide them with highly accurate tools to detect disease, risk-stratify, and optimize patient-specific treatment.

First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using AI, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which AI itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure AI system.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 69, "citationCount": 68, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2116452692", "name": "Jian-hua Li"}]}, {"paperId": "56f59b1f721e32700a638e77fff29ac18a0e0feb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/56f59b1f721e32700a638e77fff29ac18a0e0feb", "title": "Foundations of Support Constraint Machines", "abstract": "Abstract The mathematical foundations of a new theory for the design of intelligent agents are presented. The proposed learning paradigm is centered around the concept of constraint, representing the interactions with the environment, and the parsimony principle. The classical regularization framework of kernel machines is naturally extended to the case in which the agents interact with a richer environment, where abstract granules of knowledge, compactly described by different linguistic formalisms, can be translated into the unified notion of constraint for defining the hypothesis set. Constrained variational calculus is exploited to derive general representation theorems that provide a description of the optimal body of the agent (i.e., the functional structure of the optimal solution to the learning problem), which is the basis for devising new learning algorithms. We show that regardless of the kind of constraints, the optimal body of the agent is a support constraint machine (SCM) based on representer theorems that extend classical results for kernel machines and provide new representations. In a sense, the expressiveness of constraints yields a semantic-based regularization theory, which strongly restricts the hypothesis set of classical regularization. Some guidelines to unify continuous and discrete computational mechanisms are given so as to accommodate in the same framework various kinds of stimuli, for example, supervised examples and logic predicates. The proposed view of learning from constraints incorporates classical learning from examples and extends naturally to the case in which the examples are subsets of the input space, which is related to learning propositional logic clauses.", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 111, "citationCount": 45, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2264182", "name": "G.

The use of hyperkernels faces the challenge of choosing the kernel weights, the use of possibly irrelevant, poorly performing kernels, and an increased number of parameters that can lead to overfitting. In this paper we advocate the transition from SVMs to Support Kernel Machines (SKM) - models that estimate both the parameters of a sparse linear combination of kernels, and the parameters of a discriminative classifier.

However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually, and training the deep models costs quite long time to fine-tune their weights. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine-Autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed as the learning unit to learn local receptive fields at each layer, and the lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation to retain more information. In addition, some beneficial methods in deep learning architectures such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine networks to further boost the performance. The obtained trans-layer representations are followed by block histograms with binary hashing to learn translation and rotation invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as recognition and detection. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, the proposed trans-layer representation method with ELM-AE based learning of local receptive filters has much faster learning speed and is validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST and MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101.

A cross-sectional database study. Objective. The aim of this study was to train and validate machine learning models to identify risk factors for complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion. Summary of Background Data. Machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting large and complex datasets. ANNs have yet to be used for risk factor analysis in orthopedic surgery. Methods. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried for patients who underwent posterior lumbar spine fusion. This query returned 22,629 patients, 70% of whom were used to train our models, and 30% were used to evaluate the models. The predictive variables used included sex, age, ethnicity, diabetes, smoking, steroid use, coagulopathy, functional status, American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) class\u200a\u22653, body mass index (BMI), pulmonary comorbidities, and cardiac comorbidities. The models were used to predict cardiac complications, wound complications, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality. Using ASA class as a benchmark for prediction, area under receiver operating curves (AUC) was used to determine the accuracy of our machine learning models. Results. On the basis of AUC values, ANN and LR both outperformed ASA class for predicting all four types of complications. ANN was the most accurate for predicting cardiac complications, and LR was most accurate for predicting wound complications, VTE, and mortality, though ANN and LR had comparable AUC values for predicting all types of complications. ANN had greater sensitivity than LR for detecting wound complications and mortality. Conclusion. Machine learning in the form of logistic regression and ANNs were more accurate than benchmark ASA scores for identifying risk factors of developing complications following posterior lumbar spine fusion, suggesting they are potentially great tools for risk factor analysis in spine surgery.

The analogue machine has 18 input quantities from which it can compute in about 2 millisec 94 terms of a polynomial, each term containing products and powers of the input quantities, with adjustable coefficients, and can form their sum. The input quantities may be, for instance, 18 past samples of the values of a stochastic variable which is fed into the machine, and the result of the computation is an output function which contains 94 free variables. The training device optimizes the output by successive adjustment of the variable coefficients, until it has approached a target function as closely as can be achieved with a polynomial of 94 terms, by the criterion of the least mean-square error. This is done by repeatedly feeding into the machine a record of the stochastic process, long enough to be representative, and adjusting the variable coefficients, one at a time after each run, by a strategy which ensures that the error will monotonically decrease from run to run.In order to make the machine an optimum filter it is trained on a record of a noisy process, together with a target record which contains the signal only. It is taught as a predictor by taking as the target function a value of the stochastic process advanced by a certain time interval beyond the last value which goes into the input. It is trained as a simulator, for instance of an unknown mechanism, by feeding it with the input of the mechanism to be simulated at one end and presenting it at the other with its output as target function. The machine will then make itself into a model of the device to be simulated and the non-linear transfer function of the device can be read off from the final setting of the coefficients, as nearly as it can be represented by a 94-term polynomial.

In this paper, we propose to study a new problem, i.e., building a learning system that learns cumulatively. As time goes by, the system sees and learns more and more classes of data and becomes more and more knowledgeable. We believe that this is similar to human learning. We humans learn continuously, retaining the learned knowledge, identifying and learning new things, and updating the existing knowledge with new experiences. Over time, we cumulate more and more knowledge. A learning system should be able to do the same. As algorithmic learning matures, it is time to tackle this cumulative machine learning (or simply cumulative learning) problem, which is a kind of lifelong machine learning problem. It presents two major challenges. First, the system must be able to detect data from unseen classes in the test set. Classic supervised learning, however, assumes all classes in testing are known or seen at the training time. Second, the system needs to be able to selectively update its models whenever a new class of data arrives without re-training the whole system using the entire past and present training data.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.

Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques.

Manifold learning, a groundbreaking technique designed to tackle these issues of dimensionality reduction, finds widespread application in machine learning, neural networks, pattern recognition, image processing, and computer vision. Filling a void in the literature, Manifold Learning Theory and Applications incorporates state-of-the-art techniques in manifold learning with a solid theoretical and practical treatment of the subject. Comprehensive in its coverage, this pioneering work explores this novel modality from algorithm creation to successful implementationoffering examples of applications in medical, biometrics, multimedia, and computer vision. Emphasizing implementation, it highlights the various permutations of manifold learning in industry including manifold optimization, large scale manifold learning, semidefinite programming for embedding, manifold models for signal acquisition, compression and processing, and multi scale manifold. Beginning with an introduction to manifold learning theories and applications, the book includes discussions on the relevance to nonlinear dimensionality reduction, clustering, graph-based subspace learning, spectral learning and embedding, extensions, and multi-manifold modeling. It synergizes cross-domain knowledge for interdisciplinary instructions, offers a rich set of specialized topics contributed by expert professionals and researchers from a variety of fields. Finally, the book discusses specific algorithms and methodologies using case studies to apply manifold learning for real-world problems.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 177, "influentialCitationCount": 12, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2363386", "name": "Yunqian Ma"}, {"authorId": "145692782", "name": "Yun Fu"}]}, {"paperId": "2512228ada8b379f9571eba648cec950cd08ec48", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2512228ada8b379f9571eba648cec950cd08ec48", "title": "Turning 30: New Ideas in Inductive Logic Programming", "abstract": "Common criticisms of state-of-the-art machine learning include poor generalisation, a lack of interpretability, and a need for large amounts of training data.

There are two frequently used approaches to the development of intelligent agents using machine learning techniques: a content-based and a collaborative approach. In the rst approach, the content (eg., text) plays an important role, while in the second approach, the existence of several knowledge sources (eg., several users) is required. We can say that the usage of machine learning techniques on text databases (usually referred to as text-learning) is an important part of the content-based approach. Examples are agents for locating information on World Wide Web and Usenet news ltering agents. There are diierent research questions important for the development of text-learning intelligent agents. We focus on three of them: what representation is used for documents, how is the high number of features dealt with and which learning algorithm is used.
