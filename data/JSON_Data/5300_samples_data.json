MicroRNAs can be associated with disease; however, only a few microRNA-disease associations have been confirmed by traditional experimental approaches. We introduce two methods to predict microRNA-disease association. The first method, KATZ, focuses on integrating the social network analysis method with machine learning and is based on networks derived from known microRNA-disease associations, disease-disease associations, and microRNA-microRNA associations. The other method, CATAPULT, is a supervised machine learning method. We applied the two methods to 242 known microRNA-disease associations and evaluated their performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation.

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real\u2010world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to\u2010date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here.

These attacks are often sourced from virtual machines in the cloud, rather than from the attacker's own machine, to achieve anonymity and higher network bandwidth. Past research focused on analyzing traffic on the destination (victim's) side with predefined thresholds. These approaches have significant disadvantages. They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network. We evaluate nine machine learning algorithms and carefully compare their performance. Our experimental results show that more than 99.7% of four kinds of DOS attacks are successfully detected.

However, some special kinds of domain adaptation problems have been studied before under different names such as class imbalance [Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002], covariate shift [Shimodaira, 2000], and sample selection bias [Heckman, 1979]. There are also some well-studied machine learning problems that are closely related but not equivalent to domain adaptation, including multi-task learning [Caruana, 1997] and semi-supervised learning [Chapelle et al., 2006]. In this literature survey, we review existing work in both the machine learning and the natural language processing communities related to domain adaptation. Because this relatively new topic is constantly attracting attention, our survey is necessarily incomplete. Nevertheless, we try to cover the major lines of work that we are aware of up to the date this survey is written. This survey will also be constantly updated. The goal of this literature survey is twofold. First, existing studies on domain adaptation seem very different from each other, and different terms are used to refer to the problem. There has not been any survey that connects these different studies. This survey thus tries to organize the existing work in a systematic way and draw a big picture of the domain adaptation problem with its possible solutions.

Rich subgroup fairness picks a statistical fairness constraint (say, equalizing false positive rates across protected groups), but then asks that this constraint hold over an exponentially or infinitely large collection of subgroups defined by a class of functions with bounded VC dimension. They give an algorithm guaranteed to learn subject to this constraint, under the condition that it has access to oracles for perfectly learning absent a fairness constraint. In this paper, we undertake an extensive empirical evaluation of the algorithm of Kearns et al. On four real datasets for which fairness is a concern, we investigate the basic convergence of the algorithm when instantiated with fast heuristics in place of learning oracles, measure the tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy, and compare this approach with the recent algorithm of Agarwal, Beygelzeimer, Dudik, Langford, and Wallach [ICML 2018], which implements weaker and more traditional marginal fairness constraints defined by individual protected attributes. We find that in general, the Kearns et al. algorithm converges quickly, large gains in fairness can be obtained with mild costs to accuracy, and that optimizing accuracy subject only to marginal fairness leads to classifiers with substantial subgroup unfairness. We also provide a number of analyses and visualizations of the dynamics and behavior of the Kearns et al. algorithm.

This, in turn, could lead to targeted interventions that reduce the spread of healthcare-associated pathogens. In this review, we begin with an introduction to the basics of ML. We then move on to discuss how ML can transform healthcare epidemiology, providing examples of successful applications. Finally, we present special considerations for those healthcare epidemiologists who want to use and apply ML.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 39, "citationCount": 234, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38556322", "name": "J.

Our aims are to develop new machine learning approaches based on neural networks and graphical models, and to understand the capabilities of machine learning techniques relative to traditional alternatives, such as those based on constraint solving from the programming languages community. \nOur key contribution is the proposal of TerpreT, a domain-specific language for expressing program synthesis problems. TerpreT is similar to a probabilistic programming language: a model is composed of a specification of a program representation (declarations of random variables) and an interpreter describing how programs map inputs to outputs (a model connecting unknowns to observations). The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing like-to-like comparisons between different approaches to inference. From a single TerpreT specification we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends. These are based on gradient descent, linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system. \nWe illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models and performing an empirical comparison between alternative inference algorithms. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers dominate the gradient descent and LP-based formulations.

These neural networks have very different characteristics, so it is unclear which approach should be favored for hardware implementation. Yet, few studies compare them from a hardware perspective. We implement both types of networks down to the layout, and we compare the relative merit of each approach in terms of energy, speed, area cost, accuracy and functionality. Within the limit of our study (current SNN and machine learning NN algorithms, current best effort at hardware implementation efforts, and workloads used in this study), our analysis helps dispel the notion that hardware neural network accelerators inspired from neuroscience, such as SNN+STDP, are currently a competitive alternative to hardware neural networks accelerators inspired from machine-learning, such as MLP+BP: not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of hardware cost for realistic implementations, which is less expected. However, we also outline that SNN+STDP carry potential for reduced hardware cost compared to machine-learning networks at very large scales, if accuracy issues can be controlled (or for applications where they are less important). We also identify the key sources of inaccuracy of SNN+STDP which are less related to the loss of information due to spike coding than to the nature of the STDP learning algorithm.

This paper extends the work in counterfactual explanations by addressing the challenge of feasibility of such examples. For explanations of ML models in critical domains such as healthcare and finance, counterfactual examples are useful for an end-user only to the extent that perturbation of feature inputs is feasible in the real world. We formulate the problem of feasibility as preserving causal relationships among input features and present a method that uses (partial) structural causal models to generate actionable counterfactuals. When feasibility constraints cannot be easily expressed, we consider an alternative mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output. Our experiments on Bayesian networks and the widely used ''Adult-Income'' dataset show that our proposed methods can generate counterfactual explanations that better satisfy feasibility constraints than existing methods..

Such alignment reduces undesired variability due to factors such as pose, while only requiring weak supervision in the form of poorly aligned examples. However, prior work on unsupervised alignment of complex, real-world images has required the careful selection of feature representation based on hand-crafted image descriptors, in order to achieve an appropriate, smooth optimization landscape. In this paper, we instead propose a novel combination of unsupervised joint alignment with unsupervised feature learning. Specifically, we incorporate deep learning into the congealing alignment framework. Through deep learning, we obtain features that can represent the image at differing resolutions based on network depth, and that are tuned to the statistics of the specific data being aligned. In addition, we modify the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine by incorporating a group sparsity penalty, leading to a topographic organization of the learned filters and improving subsequent alignment results. We apply our method to the Labeled Faces in the Wild database (LFW).

One of the most important goals of SNP projects is to understand which human genotype variations are related to Mendelian and complex diseases. Great interest is focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are responsible of protein single point mutation. nsSNPs can be neutral or disease associated. It is known that the mutation of only one residue in a protein sequence can be related to a number of pathological conditions of dramatic social impact such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases. The quality and completeness of presently available SNPs databases allows the application of machine learning techniques to predict the insurgence of human diseases due to single point protein mutation starting from the protein sequence.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this paper, we develop a method based on support vector machines (SVMs) that starting from the protein sequence information can predict whether a new phenotype derived from a nsSNP can be related to a genetic disease in humans. Using a dataset of 21 185 single point mutations, 61% of which are disease-related, out of 3587 proteins, we show that our predictor can reach more than 74% accuracy in the specific task of predicting whether a single point mutation can be disease related or not.

While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, federated edge learning (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated \u201cover-the-air\u201d by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such broadband analog aggregation (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control (\u201ctruncated channel inversion\u201d) required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rise to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning. Next, the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA with respect to the traditional OFDMA scheme is proved to scale almost linearly with the device population.

Using these effectors, the bacteria subvert host cell processes during infection. Legionella pneumophila translocates effectors via the Icm/Dot type-IV secretion system and to date, approximately 100 effectors have been identified by various experimental and computational techniques. Effector identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the pathogenesis system in L. pneumophila as well as in other bacterial pathogens. Here, we formulate the task of effector identification as a classification problem: each L. pneumophila open reading frame (ORF) was classified as either effector or not. We computationally defined a set of features that best distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features cover a wide range of characteristics including taxonomical dispersion, regulatory data, genomic organization, similarity to eukaryotic proteomes and more. Machine learning algorithms utilizing these features were then applied to classify all the ORFs within the L. pneumophila genome. Using this approach we were able to predict and experimentally validate 40 new effectors, reaching a success rate of above 90%. Increasing the number of validated effectors to around 140, we were able to gain novel insights into their characteristics. Effectors were found to have low G+C content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of effectors originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their protozoan host. In addition, effectors were found to cluster in specific genomic regions. Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the C-terminal translocation signal required for effector translocation by the Icm/Dot secretion system. To conclude, we have discovered 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors, predicted over a hundred additional highly probable effectors, and shown the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the identification and characterization of bacterial pathogenesis determinants.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 224, "influentialCitationCount": 15, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48688893", "name": "D.

This paper presents a new classifier, kernel sparse representation-based classifier (KSRC), based on SRC and the kernel trick which is a usual technique in machine learning. KSRC is a nonlinear extension of SRC and can remedy the drawback of SRC. To make the data in an input space separable, we implicitly map these data into a high-dimensional kernel feature space by using some nonlinear mapping associated with a kernel function. Since this kernel feature space has a very high (or possibly infinite) dimensionality, or is unknown, we have to avoid working in this space explicitly. Fortunately, we can indeed reduce the dimensionality of the kernel feature space by exploiting kernel-based dimensionality reduction methods. In the reduced subspace, we need to find sparse combination coefficients for a test sample and assign a class label to it. Similar to SRC, KSRC is also cast into an \u21131-minimization problem or a quadratically constrained \u21131 -minimization problem.

Many aspects of mammalian learning are yet to be incorporated into machine learning algorithms. For instance, vision is typically considered to be a spatial problem in which a learning system needs to be trained with labeled examples of object images. Yet, mammals learn with continuously flowing unlabeled data. It is also generally accepted that the visual cortex in mammals is organized as a hierarchy and that many aspects of visual perception can be modeled using Bayesian computations. \nThis dissertation introduces algorithms and networks that combine hierarchical and temporal learning with Bayesian inference for pattern recognition. These algorithms and networks, collectively called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), can be used to learn hierarchical-temporal models of data. Temporal continuity is used to learn multiple levels of the hierarchy without supervision. The HTM algorithms, when applied to a visual pattern recognition problem, exhibit invariant recognition, robustness to noise, and generalization. Inference in the hierarchy is performed using Bayesian belief propagation equations that are adapted to this problem setting. \nIn order to understand the generalization properties of HTMs, a generative model for HTMs is developed. This model enables the generation of synthetic data from HTM networks. These data are used to analyze and characterize learning and generalization in hierarchical-temporal systems. Two existing hierarchical pattern recognition models are mapped to HTMs to explain the source of generalization in those models. \nFinally, the HTM Bayesian belief propagation equations are used to suggest a mathematical model for cortical microcircuits. The microcircuit model is derived by combining known anatomical constraints with the computational specifications of HTM belief propagation.

While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning how to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the types of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our goal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn how to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull requests. We train and experiment with the NMT model on a set of 236k pairs of code components before and after the implementation of the changes provided in the pull requests. We show that, when applied in a narrow enough context (i.e., small/medium-sized pairs of methods before/after the pull request changes), NMT can automatically replicate the changes implemented by developers during pull requests in up to 36% of the cases. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows that the model is capable of learning and replicating a wide variety of meaningful code changes, especially refactorings and bug-fixing activities.

Each case might have an objective other than classification accuracy, such as a desired true positive rate TPR or false positive rate FPR.

We show that many methods (support vector machines, stochastic gradient boosting and ridge regression) produce equally accurate models along the full ROC curve. However, methods that are designed for interpretability (classification and regression trees and C5.0) cannot be tuned to produce models that are accurate and/or interpretable. To handle this shortcoming, we use a recent method called supersparse linear integer models to produce accurate, transparent and interpretable scoring systems along the full ROC curve.

The proposed framework consists of machine learning methods for image prefiltering, similarity matching using statistical distance measures, and a relevance feedback (RF) scheme.

A category-specific statistical similarity matching is proposed in a finer level on the prefiltered images. To incorporate a better perception subjectivity, an RF mechanism is also added to update the query parameters dynamically and adjust the proposed matching functions.

Most statistical models assume linearity and few variable interactions, even though real-world ecological patterns often result from nonlinear and highly interactive processes. We here introduce a set of novel empirical modeling techniques which can address this mismatch: statistically reinforced machine learning. We demonstrate the behaviors of three techniques (conditional inference tree, model-based tree, and permutation-based random forest) by analyzing an arti \ufb01 cially generated example dataset that contains patterns based on nonlinearity and variable interactions. The results show the potential of statistically reinforced machine learning algorithms to detect nonlinear relationships and higher-order interactions. Estimation reliability for any technique, however, depended on sample size. The applications of statistically reinforced machine learning approaches would be particularly bene \ufb01 cial for investigating (1) novel patterns for which shapes cannot be assumed a priori, (2) higher-order interactions which are often overlooked in parametric statistics, (3) context dependency where patterns change depending on other conditions, (4) signi \ufb01 cance and effect sizes of variables while taking nonlinearity and variable interactions into account, and (5) a hypothesis using parametric statistics after identifying patterns using statistically reinforced machine learning techniques.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 86, "citationCount": 64, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "38057242", "name": "M.
