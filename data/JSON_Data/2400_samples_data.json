This is a very challenging problem since the direct extension of state-of-the-art white-box attacks (e.g., CW or PGD) to the hard-label black-box setting will require minimizing a non-continuous step function, which is combinatorial and cannot be solved by a gradient-based optimizer. The only current approach is based on random walk on the boundary, which requires lots of queries and lacks convergence guarantees. We propose a novel way to formulate the hard-label black-box attack as a real-valued optimization problem which is usually continuous and can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm. For example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method, we are able to bound the number of iterations needed for our algorithm to achieve stationary points. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous random walk approach to attacking convolutional neural networks on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets.

However, previously reported imaging biomarkers have not been sufficiently accurate or reproducible to enter routine clinical practice and often rely on relatively simple MRI measures. The current study leverages advanced image analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify complex and reproducible imaging patterns predictive of overall survival and molecular subtype in glioblastoma (GB).\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne hundred five patients with GB were first used to extract approximately 60 diverse features from preoperative multiparametric MRIs. These imaging features were used by a machine learning algorithm to derive imaging predictors of patient survival and molecular subtype. Cross-validation ensured generalizability of these predictors to new patients. Subsequently, the predictors were evaluated in a prospective cohort of 29 new patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSurvival curves yielded a hazard ratio of 10.64 for predicted long versus short survivors. The overall, 3-way (long/medium/short survival) accuracy in the prospective cohort approached 80%. Classification of patients into the 4 molecular subtypes of GB achieved 76% accuracy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy employing machine learning techniques, we were able to demonstrate that imaging patterns are highly predictive of patient survival. Additionally, we found that GB subtypes have distinctive imaging phenotypes. These results reveal that when imaging markers related to infiltration, cell density, microvascularity, and blood-brain barrier compromise are integrated via advanced pattern analysis methods, they form very accurate predictive biomarkers. These predictive markers used solely preoperative images, hence they can significantly augment diagnosis and treatment of GB patients.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 237, "influentialCitationCount": 8, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "5658385", "name": "L.

Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here, we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states with massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model Hamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum.

This limits their application domain. Other approaches rely on training a machine learning algorithm.

Towards ameliorating this we introduce the BLIINDS index (BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics) which is a no-reference approach to image quality assessment that does not assume a specific type of distortion of the image.

Materials and Methods The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted. Future ML challenges will catalyze collaboration and development of ML tools and methods that can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

These results were similar to those found by previous researchers using scalar genetic algorithms for scalar optimization problems. \nThe VEGA technique was then applied to multiclass pattern discrimination tasks.

This step amplifies and colors the noise, and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step, one then needs to remove the colored noise, typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However, the methods based on this two-step approach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work, we also rely on a two-step procedure, but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images, using a neural network.

For example, high-proole applications can help to secure funding for future research and can help to attract high caliber students. However, there is another reason why such papers are of value to the eld, which is, arguably, even more vital. Application papers are essential in order for Machine Learning to remain a viable science. They focus research on important unsolved problems that currently restrict the practical applicability of machine learning methods. Much of the \\science\" of Machine Learning is a science of engineering. 1 By this we mean that it is dedicated to creating and compiling veriiable knowledge related to the design and construction of artifacts. The scientiic knowledge comprises theoretical arguments, observational categorizations, empirical studies, and practical demonstrations. The artifacts are computer programs that use data to build models that are practically or theoretically useful. Because the objects of study are intended to have practical utility, it is essential for research activities to be focused (in part) on the elimination of obstacles that impede their practical application. Most often these obstacles take the form of restrictive simplifying assumptions commonly made in research. Consider as an example the assumption, common in classiier learning research, that misclassiication errors have equal costs. The vast majority of classiier learning research in Machine Learning has been conducted under this assumption, through the use of classiication accuracy as the primary (or sole) evaluation metric. Is this a reasonable assumption under which we should be operating? The answer is unclear. It is diicult to imagine a real-world classii-cation problem where error costs are equal, and researchers come in from the eld time after time citing problems dealing with unequal misclassiication costs. Nevertheless , we continue to press on with research on increasing classiication accuracy. In the Machine Learning literature isolated studies suggest that it is possible to weaken this assumption and still learn eeectively (Turney 1997), but there have been no comprehensive studies. This is but one small example of a common simplifying assumption that may be too strong. Of course it is not clear that even a very solid applications paper pointing out the inapplicability of this assumption would be suucient to convince the eld to shift its scientiic paradigm (Kuhn 1970).

In order to make organized and structured information available, automatically recognizing biomedical entity names becomes critical and is important for information retrieval, information extraction and automated knowledge acquisition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this paper, we present a named entity recognition system in the biomedical domain, called PowerBioNE. In order to deal with the special phenomena of naming conventions in the biomedical domain, we propose various evidential features: (1) word formation pattern; (2) morphological pattern, such as prefix and suffix; (3) part-of-speech; (4) head noun trigger; (5) special verb trigger and (6) name alias feature. All the features are integrated effectively and efficiently through a hidden Markov model (HMM) and a HMM-based named entity recognizer. In addition, a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is proposed to resolve the data sparseness problem in our system. Finally, we present a pattern-based post-processing to automatically extract rules from the training data to deal with the cascaded entity name phenomenon. From our best knowledge, PowerBioNE is the first system which deals with the cascaded entity name phenomenon. Evaluation shows that our system achieves the F-measure of 66.6 and 62.2 on the 23 classes of GENIA V3.0 and V1.1, respectively. In particular, our system achieves the F-measure of 75.8 on the \"protein\" class of GENIA V3.0. For comparison, our system outperforms the best published result by 7.8 on GENIA V1.1, without help of any dictionaries. It also shows that our HMM and the k-NN algorithm outperform other models, such as back-off HMM, linear interpolated HMM, support vector machines, C4.5, C4.5 rules and RIPPER, by effectively capturing the local context dependency and resolving the data sparseness problem. Moreover, evaluation on GENIA V3.0 shows that the post-processing for the cascaded entity name phenomenon improves the F-measure by 3.9. Finally, error analysis shows that about half of the errors are caused by the strict annotation scheme and the annotation inconsistency in the GENIA corpus. This suggests that our system achieves an acceptable F-measure of 83.6 on the 23 classes of GENIA V3.0 and in particular 86.2 on the \"protein\" class, without help of any dictionaries. We think that a F-measure of 90 on the 23 classes of GENIA V3.0 and in particular 92 on the \"protein\" class, can be achieved through refining of the annotation scheme in the GENIA corpus, such as flexible annotation scheme and annotation consistency, and inclusion of a reasonable biomedical dictionary.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nA demo system is available at http://textmining.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/NLS/demo.htm.

Here, we present a brief overview of deep learning methods and show in particular how recursive neural network approaches can be applied to the problem of predicting molecular properties. However, molecules are typically described by undirected cyclic graphs, while recursive approaches typically use directed acyclic graphs. Thus, we develop methods to address this discrepancy, essentially by considering an ensemble of recursive neural networks associated with all possible vertex-centered acyclic orientations of the molecular graph. One advantage of this approach is that it relies only minimally on the identification of suitable molecular descriptors because suitable representations are learned automatically from the data. Several variants of this approach are applied to the problem of predicting aqueous solubility and tested on four benchmark data sets. Experimental results show that the performance of the deep learning methods matches or exceeds the performance of other state-of-the-art methods according to several evaluation metrics and expose the fundamental limitations arising from training sets that are too small or too noisy.

Like other data mining and machine learning tasks, multilabel learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction has been studied for many years, however, multilabel dimensionality reduction remains almost untouched. In this article, we propose a multilabel dimensionality reduction method, MDDM, with two kinds of projection strategies, attempting to project the original data into a lower-dimensional feature space maximizing the dependence between the original feature description and the associated class labels. Based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, we derive a eigen-decomposition problem which enables the dimensionality reduction process to be efficient.

We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 76, "citationCount": 207, "influentialCitationCount": 11, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2083807", "name": "B.

This contrasts with passive learning, where the labeled data are taken at random. The objective in active learning is to produce a highly-accurate classifier, ideally using fewer labels than the number of random labeled data sufficient for passive learning to achieve the same. This article describes recent advances in our understanding of the theoretical benefits of active learning, and implications for the design of effective active learning algorithms. Much of the article focuses on a particular technique, namely disagreement-based active learning, which by now has amassed a mature and coherent literature. It also briefly surveys several alternative approaches from the literature. The emphasis is on theorems regarding the performance of a few general algorithms, including rigorous proofs where appropriate. However, the presentation is intended to be pedagogical, focusing on results that illustrate fundamental ideas, rather than obtaining the strongest or most general known theorems.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that such adversarial examples are not very effective in the physical world--they either completely fail to cause misclassification or only work in restricted cases where a relatively complex image is perturbed and printed on paper. In this paper we propose a new attack algorithm--Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2)-- that generates perturbations by taking images under different conditions into account. Our algorithm can create spatially-constrained perturbations that mimic vandalism or art to reduce the likelihood of detection by a casual observer. We show that adversarial examples generated by RP2 achieve high success rates under various conditions for real road sign recognition by using an evaluation methodology that captures physical world conditions. We physically realized and evaluated two attacks, one that causes a Stop sign to be misclassified as a Speed Limit sign in 100% of the testing conditions, and one that causes a Right Turn sign to be misclassified as either a Stop or Added Lane sign in 100% of the testing conditions.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 263, "influentialCitationCount": 20, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "22229139", "name": "I.
