Researchers have proven that the target-side monolingual data can greatly enhance the decoder model of NMT. However, the source-side monolingual data is not fully explored although it should be useful to strengthen the encoder model of NMT, especially when the parallel corpus is far from sufficient. In this paper, we propose two approaches to make full use of the sourceside monolingual data in NMT. The first approach employs the self-learning algorithm to generate the synthetic large-scale parallel data for NMT training. The second approach applies the multi-task learning framework using two NMTs to predict the translation and the reordered source-side monolingual sentences simultaneously.

As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, the support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high- (or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet a certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the \"curse of dimensionality.\" Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results.

Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However, simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as state and strategy. In the present work we use machine learning to enhance pattern mining by filtering out as many false hits as possible.

We found that: (1) SVM and NB were superior to CART and KNN, and both could achieve high classification accuracy (>90%); (2) the setting of tuning parameters greatly affected classification accuracy, particularly for the most commonly-used SVM classifier; the optimal values of tuning parameters might vary slightly with the size of training samples; (3) the size of training sample also greatly affected the classification accuracy, when the size of training sample was less than 125. Increasing the size of training samples generally led to the increase of classification accuracies for all four classifiers. In addition, NB and KNN were more sensitive to the sample sizes.

Strong PUFs represent a variant of PUFs which respond to a user challenge with a response determined by its unique manufacturing process variations. Unfortunately many of the Strong PUFs have been shown to be vulnerable to model building attacks when an attacker has access to challenge and response pairs. In mounting a model building attack, typically machine learning is used to build a software model to forge the PUF. Researchers have long been interested in designing Strong PUFs that are resistant to model building attacks. However, with innovations in application of machine learning, nearly all Strong PUFs presented in the literature have been broken. In this paper, first we present results from a set of experiments designed to show that if certain randomness properties can be met, cascaded structure based Strong PUFs can indeed be made machine learning (ML) attack resistant against known ML attacks. Next we conduct machine learning experiments on an abstract PUF model using Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting and Evolutionary techniques to establish criteria for machine learning resistant Strong PUF design. This paper does not suggest how to harvest the process variation, which remains within the purview of a circuit designer; rather it suggests what properties of the building blocks to aim for towards building a machine learning resistant Strong PUF - thus paving the path for a systematic design approach.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 62, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1959971", "name": "Arunkumar Vijayakumar"}, {"authorId": "1932795", "name": "Vinay C.

Chiron is implemented using SGX enclaves, but SGX alone does not achieve the dual goals of data privacy and model confidentiality. Chiron runs the standard ML training toolchain (including the popular Theano framework and C compiler) in an enclave, but the untrusted model-creation code from the service operator is further confined in a Ryoan sandbox to prevent it from leaking the training data outside the enclave. To support distributed training, Chiron executes multiple concurrent enclaves that exchange model parameters via a parameter server.

Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.

However, classifier training with a non-convex loss is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we discuss a convex formulation for PU classification that can still cancel the bias. The key idea is to use different loss functions for positive and unlabeled samples. However, in this setup, the hinge loss is not permissible. As an alternative, we propose the double hinge loss.

Machine learning has been an effective tool in both of these environments by augmenting the flexibility and reliability of robotic systems, but this is often a very difficult problem because the complexity of learning in the real world introduces very high dimensional state spaces and applies severe penalties for mistakes. Human children are raised in environments that are just as complex (or even more so) than those typically studied in robot learning scenarios. However, the presence of parents and other caregivers radically changes the type of learning that is possible. Consciously and unconsciously, adults tailor their actions and the environment to the child.

Our robots interact socially with human adults using the same natural conventions that a human child would use.

Several proposed local explanation methods address this issue by identifying what dimensions of a single input are most responsible for a DNN's output.

Somewhat surprisingly, we find that DNNs with randomly-initialized weights produce explanations that are both visually and quantitatively similar to those produced by DNNs with learned weights. Our conjecture is that this phenomenon occurs because these explanations are dominated by the lower level features of a DNN, and that a DNN's architecture provides a strong prior which significantly affects the representations learned at these lower layers.

These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches.

We present the surprising finding that while importance weighting impacts models early in training, its effect diminishes over successive epochs. Moreover, while L2 regularization and batch normalization (but not dropout), restore some of the impact of importance weighting, they express the effect via (seemingly) the wrong abstraction: why should practitioners tweak the L2 regularization, and by how much, to produce the correct weighting effect?

However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior -- often referred to as gaming -- the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming. We model classification as a sequential game between a player named \"Jury\" and a player named \"Contestant.\" Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier drawn from a distribution. Before being classified, Contestant may change his input based on Jury's classifier. However, Contestant incurs a cost for these changes according to a cost function. Jury's goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's original input and some underlying target classification function, assuming Contestant plays best response. Contestant's goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account the cost of achieving it. For a natural class of \"separable\" cost functions, and certain generalizations, we obtain computationally efficient learning algorithms which are near optimal, achieving a classification error that is arbitrarily close to the theoretical minimum. Surprisingly, our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn.

Reinforcement Learning problems are characterized by a long-term interaction between the learning agent and a dynamic, unfamiliar, uncertain, possibly even hostile environment. Mathematically, this interaction is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Probably the most significant contribution of this thesis is in the introduction of a new class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, which leverage the power of a statistical set of tools known as Gaussian Processes.

Machine learning methods can be applied to discover new disease genes based on the known ones. Existing machine learning methods typically use the known disease genes as the positive training set P and the unknown genes as the negative training set N (non-disease gene set does not exist) to build classifiers to identify new disease genes from the unknown genes. However, such kind of classifiers is actually built from a noisy negative set N as there can be unknown disease genes in N itself. As a result, the classifiers do not perform as well as they could be. Result: Instead of treating the unknown genes as negative examples in N, we treat them as an unlabeled set U. We design a novel positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithm PUDI (PU learning for disease gene identification) to build a classifier using P and U. We first partition U into four sets, namely, reliable negative set RN, likely positive set LP, likely negative set LN and weak negative set WN. The weighted support vector machines are then used to build a multi-level classifier based on the four training sets and positive training set P to identify disease genes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PUDI algorithm outperformed the existing methods significantly. Conclusion: The proposed PUDI algorithm is able to identify disease genes more accurately by treating the unknown data more appropriately as unlabeled set U instead of negative set N. Given that many machine learning problems in biomedical research do involve positive and unlabeled data instead of negative data, it is possible that the machine learning methods for these problems can be further improved by adopting PU learning methods, as we have done here for disease gene identification.

These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set.

Change classification uses a machine learning classifier to determine whether a new software change is more similar to prior buggy changes or clean changes.

The classifier is trained using features (in the machine learning sense) extracted from the revision history of a software project stored in its software configuration management repository. The trained classifier can classify changes as buggy or clean, with a 78 percent accuracy and a 60 percent buggy change recall on average. Change classification has several desirable qualities: 1) The prediction granularity is small (a change to a single file), 2) predictions do not require semantic information about the source code, 3) the technique works for a broad array of project types and programming languages, and 4) predictions can be made immediately upon the completion of a change.

Machine learning has recently emerged as a promising tool for advancing suicide science, particularly in the domain of suicide prediction.

Although only a few studies have implemented machine learning for suicide prediction, results to date indicate considerable improvement in accuracy and positive predictive value. Potential barriers to algorithm integration into clinical practice are discussed, as well as attendant ethical issues. Overall, machine learning approaches hold promise for accurate, scalable, and effective suicide risk detection; however, many critical questions and issues remain unexplored.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 29, "citationCount": 68, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "14864293", "name": "Kathryn P Linthicum"}, {"authorId": "67345170", "name": "K.
