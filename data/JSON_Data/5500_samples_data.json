How do they do this? More specifically, how do children map from complex, physical signals to grammars that enable them to generate and interpret new utterances from their language? \nThis thesis presents a computational theory of unsupervised language acquisition. By computational we mean that the theory precisely defines procedures for learning language, procedures that have been implemented and tested in the form of computer programs. By unsupervised we mean that the theory explains how language learning can take place with no explicit help from a teacher, but only exposure to ordinary spoken or written utterances. The theory requires very little of the learning environment. For example, it predicts that much knowledge of language can be acquired even in situations where the learner has no access to the meaning of utterances. In this way the theory is extremely conservative, making few or no assumptions that are not obviously true of the situation children learn in. \nThe theory is based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical estimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic, generative model of language to the evidence. Thus, the goal of the learner is to acquire a grammar under which the evidence is \"typical\", in a statistical sense. Much of the thesis is devoted to explaining conditions that must hold for this learning strategy to arrive at the desired form of grammar. The thesis introduces a variety of technical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and grammars that has many linguistically and statistically desirable properties. In this representation, both utterances and parameters in the grammar are represented by composing parameters. A second contribution is a learning strategy that separates the \"content\" of linguistic parameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of the search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to language acquisition. \nThe theory has been tested on problems of learning lexicons (vocabularies) from text and speech signals. It performs extremely well on various objective criteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same linguistic structure to utterances as humans do. The theory has application to data compression, speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval, and other tasks that rely on either structural or stochastic descriptions of language.

Using these effectors, the bacteria subvert host cell processes during infection. Legionella pneumophila translocates effectors via the Icm/Dot type-IV secretion system and to date, approximately 100 effectors have been identified by various experimental and computational techniques. Effector identification is a critical first step towards the understanding of the pathogenesis system in L. pneumophila as well as in other bacterial pathogens. Here, we formulate the task of effector identification as a classification problem: each L. pneumophila open reading frame (ORF) was classified as either effector or not. We computationally defined a set of features that best distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features cover a wide range of characteristics including taxonomical dispersion, regulatory data, genomic organization, similarity to eukaryotic proteomes and more. Machine learning algorithms utilizing these features were then applied to classify all the ORFs within the L. pneumophila genome. Using this approach we were able to predict and experimentally validate 40 new effectors, reaching a success rate of above 90%. Increasing the number of validated effectors to around 140, we were able to gain novel insights into their characteristics. Effectors were found to have low G+C content, supporting the hypothesis that a large number of effectors originate via horizontal gene transfer, probably from their protozoan host. In addition, effectors were found to cluster in specific genomic regions. Finally, we were able to provide a novel description of the C-terminal translocation signal required for effector translocation by the Icm/Dot secretion system. To conclude, we have discovered 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors, predicted over a hundred additional highly probable effectors, and shown the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the identification and characterization of bacterial pathogenesis determinants.", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount": 224, "influentialCitationCount": 15, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48688893", "name": "D.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed.

For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount": 191, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145959882", "name": "G.

To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. However, due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, it is not practical for federated learning to perform model updates and aggregation on all participating devices in parallel. Besides, data samples across all devices are usually not independent and identically distributed (IID), posing additional challenges to the convergence and speed of federated learning. In this paper, we propose Favor, an experience-driven control framework that intelligently chooses the client devices to participate in each round of federated learning to counterbalance the bias introduced by non-IID data and to speed up convergence. Through both empirical and mathematical analysis, we observe an implicit connection between the distribution of training data on a device and the model weights trained based on those data, which enables us to profile the data distribution on that device based on its uploaded model weights. We then propose a mechanism based on deep Q-learning that learns to select a subset of devices in each communication round to maximize a reward that encourages the increase of validation accuracy and penalizes the use of more communication rounds. With extensive experiments performed in PyTorch, we show that the number of communication rounds required in federated learning can be reduced by up to 49% on the MNIST dataset, 23% on FashionMNIST, and 42% on CIFAR-10, as compared to the Federated Averaging algorithm.", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 18, "citationCount": 236, "influentialCitationCount": 27, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "39483391", "name": "Hao Wang"}, {"authorId": "2005216177", "name": "Zakhary Kaplan"}, {"authorId": "1714907", "name": "Di Niu"}, {"authorId": "91269142", "name": "Baochun Li"}]}, {"paperId": "364f02eff4f10ea602d86fd8c98c8694b76f46fd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/364f02eff4f10ea602d86fd8c98c8694b76f46fd", "title": "Problems with Shapley-value-based explanations as feature importance measures", "abstract": "Game-theoretic formulations of feature importance have become popular as a way to \"explain\" machine learning models.

We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design, algorithmic adjustment, and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we develop a system for model-parallelism, STRADS, that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs.

However, the development of a drowsiness detection system that yields reliable and accurate results is a challenging task as it requires accurate and robust algorithms. A wide range of techniques has been examined to detect driver drowsiness in the past.

As a result, this paper reviews machine learning techniques which include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models in the context of drowsiness detection. Furthermore, a meta-analysis is conducted on 25 papers that use machine learning techniques for drowsiness detection.

Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps.

The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation.

However, most structure modeling approaches only use the template-based contact predictions in guiding the simulations; this is partly because the sequence-based contact predictions are usually considered to be less accurate than that by threading. With the rapid progress in sequence databases and machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to have a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the contact-prediction methods in different template conditions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe develop two methods for protein-contact predictions: SVM-SEQ is a sequence-based machine learning approach which trains a variety of sequence-derived features on contact maps; SVM-LOMETS collects consensus contact predictions from multiple threading templates. We test both methods on the same set of 554 proteins which are categorized into 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard' and 'Very Hard' targets based on the evolutionary and structural distance between templates and targets. For the Easy and Medium targets, SVM-LOMETS obviously outperforms SVM-SEQ; but for the Hard and Very Hard targets, the accuracy of the SVM-SEQ predictions is higher than that of SVM-LOMETS by 12-25%. If we combine the SVM-SEQ and SVM-LOMETS predictions together, the total number of correctly predicted contacts in the Hard proteins will increase by more than 60% (or 70% for the long-range contact with a sequence separation > or =24), compared with SVM-LOMETS alone. The advantage of SVM-SEQ is also shown in the CASP7 free modeling targets where the SVM-SEQ is around four times more accurate than SVM-LOMETS in the long-range contact prediction. These data demonstrate that the state-of-the-art sequence-based contact prediction has reached a level which may be helpful in assisting tertiary structure modeling for the targets which do not have close structure templates.

According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 246 million diabetic people worldwide, and this number is expected to rise to 380 million by 2025. Furthermore, 3.8 million deaths are attributable to diabetes complications each year. It has been shown that 80% of type 2 diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed by early identification of people at risk. In this context, several data mining and machine learning methods have been used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. In this paper, we propose utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the diagnosis of diabetes. In particular, we use an additional explanation module, which turns the \u201cblack box\u201d model of an SVM into an intelligible representation of the SVM's diagnostic (classification) decision. Results on a real-life diabetes dataset show that intelligible SVMs provide a promising tool for the prediction of diabetes, where a comprehensible ruleset have been generated, with prediction accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 94%.

In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s.

Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration.

We exemplify this translation procedure for a new algorithm: one-class leveraging, starting from the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM). This is a first step toward unsupervised learning in a boosting framework. Building on so-called barrier methods known from the theory of constrained optimization, it returns a function, written as a convex combination of base hypotheses, that characterizes whether a given test point is likely to have been generated from the distribution underlying the training data. Simulations on one-class classification problems demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 252, "influentialCitationCount": 19, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2414086", "name": "G.
