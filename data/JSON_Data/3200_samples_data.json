Revolt eliminates the burden of creating detailed label guidelines by harnessing crowd disagreements to identify ambiguous concepts and create rich structures (groups of semantically related items) for post-hoc label decisions. Experiments comparing Revolt to traditional crowdsourced labeling show that Revolt produces high quality labels without requiring label guidelines in turn for an increase in monetary cost.

Here we present a supervised machine learning approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput, image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i.e., classifier) to recognize cells with a phenotype of interest during a short, interactive training session using iterative feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the presence of cells displaying the phenotype.

Methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction have been used to provide a simplified, coarse-grained representation of the structure and dynamics of complex systems from proteins to nanoparticles. In recent years, the rise of machine learning has led to an even more widespread use of these algorithms in atomistic modeling and to consider different classification and inference techniques as part of a coherent toolbox of data-driven approaches. This perspective briefly reviews some of the unsupervised machine-learning methods-that are geared toward classification and coarse-graining of molecular simulations-seen in relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie all machine-learning techniques. It discusses the importance of using concise yet complete representations of atomic structures as the starting point of the analyses and highlights the risk of introducing preconceived biases when using machine learning to rationalize and understand structure-property relations. Supervised machine-learning techniques that explicitly attempt to predict the properties of a material given its structure are less susceptible to such biases.

Perfect detection of unauthorized IoT device types was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99.49% accuracy.

Previous work has identified a number of statistical biases due to characteristics of relational data such as autocorrelation and degree disparity. The RPT algorithm uses a novel form of randomization test to adjust for these biases. On a variety of relational learning tasks, RPTs built using randomization tests are significantly smaller than other models and achieve equivalent, or better, performance.", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount": 259, "influentialCitationCount": 37, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "144050371", "name": "Jennifer Neville"}, {"authorId": "144774129", "name": "David D.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have been of special interest, since they can be applied in several steps of the drug discovery methodology, such as prediction of target structure, prediction of biological activity of new ligands through model construction, discovery or optimization of hits, and construction of models that predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological (ADMET) profile of compounds. Areas covered: This article presents an overview on some applications of ML techniques in drug design. These techniques can be employed in ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) studies, such as similarity searches, construction of classification and/or prediction models of biological activity, prediction of secondary structures and binding sites docking and virtual screening. Expert opinion: Successful cases have been reported in the literature, demonstrating the efficiency of ML techniques combined with traditional approaches to study medicinal chemistry problems. Some ML techniques used in drug design are: support vector machine, random forest, decision trees and artificial neural networks. Currently, an important application of ML techniques is related to the calculation of scoring functions used in docking and virtual screening assays from a consensus, combining traditional and ML techniques in order to improve the prediction of binding sites and docking solutions.", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 184, "citationCount": 160, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46480421", "name": "Ang\u00e9lica Nakagawa Lima"}, {"authorId": "2335673", "name": "E.

In this paper, we offer a unifying view of the different approaches to kernelized value function approximation for reinforcement learning. We show that, except for different approaches to regularization, Kernelized LSTD (KLSTD) is equivalent to a modelbased approach that uses kernelized regression to find an approximate reward and transition model, and that Gaussian Process Temporal Difference learning (GPTD) returns a mean value function that is equivalent to these other approaches.

This FIT project study used data of 32,555 patients who are free of any known coronary artery disease or heart failure who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 5-year follow-up.

The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark.

Participants were recruited between February 2014 and May 2016, and data were analyzed from April 2017 to January 2018.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPerformance and generalizability of prognostic models.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 116 individuals in CHR states (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [5.1] years; 58 [50.0%] female) and 120 patients with ROD (mean [SD] age, 26.1 [6.1] years; 65 [54.2%] female) were followed up for a mean (SD) of 329 (142) days. Machine learning predicted the 1-year social-functioning outcomes with a balanced accuracy of 76.9% of patients in CHR states and 66.2% of patients with ROD using clinical baseline data. Balanced accuracy in models using structural neuroimaging was 76.2% in patients in CHR states and 65.0% in patients with ROD, and in combined models, it was 82.7% for CHR states and 70.3% for ROD. Lower functioning before study entry was a transdiagnostic predictor. Medial prefrontal and temporo-parieto-occipital gray matter volume (GMV) reductions and cerebellar and dorsolateral prefrontal GMV increments had predictive value in the CHR group; reduced mediotemporal and increased prefrontal-perisylvian GMV had predictive value in patients with ROD. Poor prognoses were associated with increased risk of psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders at follow-up in patients in the CHR state but not ones with ROD. Machine learning outperformed expert prognostication. Adding neuroimaging machine learning to clinical machine learning provided a 1.9-fold increase of prognostic certainty in uncertain cases of patients in CHR states, and a 10.5-fold increase of prognostic certainty for patients with ROD.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nPrecision medicine tools could augment effective therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention of social functioning impairments in patients with CHR states or with ROD.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 106, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "3214043", "name": "N.

A novel regression technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this study. SVM is based on the principle of Structural Risk Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization espoused by conventional regression techniques. The flood data at Dhaka, Bangladesh, are used in this study to demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of SVM. The result is compared with that of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model for one\u2010lead day to seven\u2010lead day forecasting. The improvements in maximum predicted water level errors by SVM over ANN for four\u2010lead day to seven\u2010lead day are 9.6 cm, 22.6 cm, 4.9 cm and 15.7 cm, respectively. The result shows that the prediction accuracy of SVM is at least as good as and in some cases (particularly at higher lead days) actually better than that of ANN, yet it offers advantages over many of the limitations of ANN, for example in arriving at ANN's optimal network architecture and choosing useful training set.

Since the applicability of these simulation techniques is limited by the costs of the underlying electronic structure calculations, we develop and assess different machine learning models for this task. The machine learning models are trained on ab initio calculations for excited electronic states, using the methylenimmonium cation (CH2NH 2+ ) as a model system. Two distinct strategies for modeling excited state properties are tested in this work. The first strategy is to treat each state separately in a kernel ridge regression model and all states together in a multiclass neural network. The second strategy is to instead encode the state as input into the model, which is tested with both models. Numerical evidence suggests that using the state as input yields the best performance. An important goal for excited-state machine learning models is their use in dynamics simulations, which needs not only state-specific information but also couplings, i.e. properties involving pairs of states. Accordingly, we investigate how well machine learning models can predict the couplings. Furthermore, we explore how combining all properties in a single neural network affects the accuracy. Finally, machine learning predicted energies, forces, and couplings are used to carry out excited-state dynamics simulations.

As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, the support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high- (or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet a certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the \"curse of dimensionality.\" Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results.

However, simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as state and strategy.

Existing ML-as-a-service platforms require users to reveal all training data to the service operator. We design, implement, and evaluate Chiron, a system for privacy-preserving machine learning as a service. First, Chiron conceals the training data from the service operator. Second, in keeping with how many existing ML-as-a-service platforms work, Chiron reveals neither the training algorithm nor the model structure to the user, providing only black-box access to the trained model. Chiron is implemented using SGX enclaves, but SGX alone does not achieve the dual goals of data privacy and model confidentiality. Chiron runs the standard ML training toolchain (including the popular Theano framework and C compiler) in an enclave, but the untrusted model-creation code from the service operator is further confined in a Ryoan sandbox to prevent it from leaking the training data outside the enclave. To support distributed training, Chiron executes multiple concurrent enclaves that exchange model parameters via a parameter server. We evaluate Chiron on popular deep learning models, focusing on benchmark image classification tasks such as CIFAR and ImageNet, and show that its training performance and accuracy of the resulting models are practical for common uses of ML-as-a-service.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 54, "citationCount": 145, "influentialCitationCount": 14, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48062937", "name": "T.
