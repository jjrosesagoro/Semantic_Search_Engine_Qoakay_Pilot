Vast amount of such data are stored in different locations, on many different devices and in different data silos. Sharing data among different sources is a big challenge due to regulatory, operational and security reasons. One potential solution is federated machine learning, which is a method that sends machine learning algorithms simultaneously to all data sources, trains models in each source and aggregates the learned models. This strategy allows utilization of valuable data without moving them. One challenge in applying federated machine learning is the possibly different distributions of data from diverse sources. To tackle this problem, we proposed an adaptive boosting method named LoAdaBoost that increases the efficiency of federated machine learning. Using intensive care unit data from hospitals, we investigated the performance of learning in IID and non-IID data distribution scenarios, and showed that the proposed LoAdaBoost method achieved higher predictive accuracy with lower computational complexity than the baseline method.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 64, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2143702320", "name": "Li Huang"}, {"authorId": "1640266327", "name": "Yifeng Yin"}, {"authorId": "2068057580", "name": "Z.

Existing approaches focus either on mapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract features that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation between the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each domain. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling what is unique to each domain can improve a model's ability to extract domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one component which is private to each domain and one which is shared across domains. Our model is trained to not only perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both domains.

Such learning approaches are useful for many interesting real-world applications, but particularly shine for tasks involving the automatic organization, extraction, and retrieval of information from large collections of data (e.g., text, images, and other digital media). \nIn traditional supervised learning, one uses \"labeled\" training data to induce a model. However, labeled instances for real-world applications are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain. Consider a complex task such as extracting key person and organization names from text documents. While gathering large amounts of unlabeled documents for these tasks is often relatively easy (e.g., from the World Wide Web), labeling these texts usually requires experienced human annotators with specific domain knowledge and training. There are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. This is especially true for applications that involve learning from instances with complex structures, which can require labels at varying levels of granularity. \nActive learning addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the learner to selectively choose which parts of the available data are labeled for training. The goal is to maximize the accuracy of the learner through such \"queries,\" while minimizing the work required of human annotators. In this thesis, I explore several important questions regarding active learning for these and similar tasks involving structured instances. What query strategies are available for these learning algorithms, and how do they compare? How might a learner pose queries at different levels of granularity, as with multiple-instance learning? Are there relationships between certain properties of a query and its difficulty for the annotator? If so, can these relationships be learned and exploited during active learning?

They are only passive defenses after the attack, they cannot use the outbound statistical features of attacks, and it is hard to trace back to the attacker with these approaches. In this paper, we propose a DOS attack detection system on the source side in the cloud, based on machine learning techniques. This system leverages statistical information from both the cloud server's hypervisor and the virtual machines, to prevent network packages from being sent out to the outside network.

In this contribution, we analyze the performance of a particular method--online centroid anomaly detection--in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, and analysis of attack efficiency and limitations. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly detection under different conditions: attacker's full or limited control over the traffic and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used.

Machine learning methods may excel at finding new features or nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as handling settings with more predictor variables than observations. However, the usefulness of both these data and machine learning has varied. Electronic health data often have quality issues (eg, missingness, misclassification, measurement error), and machine learning may perform similarly to standard techniques for some research questions. Ensembles (running multiple algorithms and either selecting the single best algorithm or creating a weighted average) can help mitigate the latter concern. Using several machine learning tools, Wong et al1 predicted delirium risk for newly hospitalized patients with high-dimensional electronic health record data at a large academic health institution. They compared these approaches with a questionnaire-based scoring system and found improved performance for machine learning with respect to several metrics calculated in a single holdout sample. Their article is a step toward updating delirium risk prediction. It also provides an opportunity to discuss 2 key issues in the current state of machine learning for prediction in electronic health data: evaluation and generalizability. The machine learning researchers who develop novel algorithms for prediction and the clinical teams interested in implementing them are frequently and unfortunately 2 nonintersecting groups. Thus, these algorithms may originally be built and evaluated in the machine learning literature based on metrics that are less clinically useful than other choices. Computer scientists and statisticians may optimize to achieve the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), but what a clinical team might need is high sensitivity or positive predictive value. Worse yet, algorithms can have misleading performance when evaluated only along 1 or 2 dimensions. For example, high AUC, accuracy, and positive predictive values can be accompanied by near-zero levels of sensitivity and specificity. It can also be essential to calculate metrics like the percentage of true cases in the top risk percentile.2 This is especially important when a goal of the tool is to target high-risk patients for interventions. Wong and colleagues1 helpfully compute AUC, positive predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. However, one accepted standard for evaluation that should be adopted in future clinical machine learning applications is K-fold cross-validation (eg, with K = 10) rather than the single holdout validation sample in their article. K-fold cross-validation involves K successive mutually exclusive validation sets where the algorithm fitting is iteratively performed on the nonvalidation data (ie, training set). At the end, each observation in the full data has a predicted value that was obtained from when it was part of a validation set. Typically, metrics calculated based on these K-fold cross-validated predicted values will more effectively assess overfitting and have lower variance.3 Of course, assessing the generalizability of a prediction algorithm goes well beyond using crossvalidated metrics to evaluate overfitting. Wong et al1 carefully discussed a number of limitations in their work, including the lack of external validation in other health systems. As in similar studies, the step from good performance in the study to a generalizable algorithm is vast and sometimes may not be feasible. Patients receiving treatment in varied care settings or geographic regions simply may require tailored tools. Recognizing the need for unique tools in different populations is not inherently negative, but one of many considerations not magically solved by using machine learning. Even those algorithms that prove to be generalizable may quickly become outdated as treatment patterns or physician incentives to code health conditions change.4 Increased social tolerance for certain + Related article", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount": 54, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "48345067", "name": "Sherri Rose"}]}, {"paperId": "cedea36fa3692281b3ac767335fe49a16d00957d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cedea36fa3692281b3ac767335fe49a16d00957d", "title": "Structural Topic Models for Open\u2010Ended Survey Responses", "abstract": "Collection and especially analysis of open-ended survey responses are relatively rare in the discipline and when conducted are almost exclusively done through human coding.

In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations.

Being more specific, the authors have focused on various inference paradigms developed within a framework of the computational learning theory. The content in the book, as stated by authors, encompasses ideas, experience and experiments developed throughout the life of the Laboratory for Neural Networks, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. The volume is structured into five chapters. The first one titled \u201cKnowledge versus randomness\u201d addresses an important and practically relevant question of relationships between these two concepts and demonstrates how probabilistic models help capture and quantify randomness. Most of this chapter serves as a solid prerequisite to the rest of the book by covering the fundamentals of calculus of random variables. The next chapter focuses on mechanisms of algorithmic inferences realized in the statistical setting. The reader finds here ideas of sufficient statistics, confidence intervals, adequacy of sample size, point estimators, and issues of entropy. The first two chapters naturally form the introductory part of the book as dealing with the foundations of the subject. The second part is about the applications of machine learning and consists of three comprehensive chapters: on computational learning theory, regression theory, and subsymbolic learning. This combination very much reflects the main directions of the key developments encountered in machine learning. Chapter 3 is devoted to computational learning and includes its core concepts. Learning Boolean functions along with their well known probably approximately correct (PAC) principle occupies a prominent position in the theory and the same becomes true in this chapter. A lot of attention is paid to computing the hypotheses, confidence intervals for learning errors, high level abstraction and learnability. The chapter on regression theory (Chapter 4) is quite extensive and includes aspects of linear and nonlinear regression, PAC learning of regression functions, point estimators and confidence intervals. When looking at neural networks (the subject covered in a number of sections of the book), it is worth stressing that this material is nicely cast in the framework of the general learning theory. I would say this is a quite inspiring environment that is both useful and appealing to newcomers to the area of neurocomputing as well as those very much versatile in learning algorithms of neural networks. Neural networks dominate a chapter on subsymbolic learning (Chapter 5 of the book). Here the authors cover a generic taxonomy of the networks, elaborate on various learning strategies (cast in the setting of machine learning) and tackle the subject of learning without supervision (self associative memories and self-organizing memories/maps). Some of the topics that deliver another look at neural networks concern networks and data compression (the compression relates to the idea of Kolgomorov complexity), sufficient statistics, and stochastic facets of learning mechanisms. A comprehensive, well-organized and carefully compiled bibliography is an asset of the book; one can find here entries to classic texts in statistics, probability, learning theory, fuzzy sets, granular computing, and neural networks.

The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC).

Information such as continuous proximity, location, communication and activity data, has been gathered from the phones of 100 human subjects at MIT. Systematic measurements from these 100 people over the course of eight months have generated one of the largest datasets of continuous human behavior ever collected, representing over 300,000 hours of daily activity.

In this editorial, we only include those that we considered major league and leave analysis of the minor league methods as an exercise for the interested reader. To create our league table, we created a list of supervised machine learning techniques commonly used in bioinformatics and their common synonyms, plural forms and abbreviations. We then searched this list against the PubMed titles and abstracts to identify the number of papers published per year for each machine learning technique. To match as many papers as possible, searches were case insensitive and allowed for variation in hyphenation. \n \nTo our surprise, the artificial neural network (ANN) is not only the dominant league leader in 2011 but has been in this position since at least the 1970s (see Fig. 1). However, in recent years the usage of support vector machines (SVMs) grew tremendously, and we predict that SVMs will challenge ANNs for the dominant position in the coming decade. Since 2007 the number of publications using ANNs has decreased by 21%, which we hypothesize may be directly attributed to researchers increasingly using SVMs in place of ANNs. SVMs caught up with and overtook Markov models in 2004 to gain second spot in our machine learning league. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. \n \nThe growth of supervised machine learning methods in PubMed. \n \n \n \nAs for the question of \u2018what is hot?\u2019, one can see that Random forests are a rapidly growing method with not a single mention of them before 2003 and now a total of 407 papers published to date. \n \nWe were hoping to find techniques that were not so hot and perhaps going out of fashion. The results show that none of the major league methods has gone out of fashion, but we do see moderate decreases in the use of both ANNs and Markov models in the literature. \n \nWe were also curious to find out if certain machine learning techniques were used in combination with each other. To investigate this, we looked at what machine learning methods are co-mentioned in articles (See Fig. 2). For all pairs of methods from the Supervised Machine Learning Top-5, we counted the number of abstracts that mention both methods and normalized the counts with the number of co-occurrences that would be expected by chance (based on the frequencies with which the methods are mentioned over the years). The strongest correlation (185 times higher than random expectation) is seen between decision trees and random forests, which is to be expected as random forests are ensembles of decision trees. Apart from this, the next strongest correlation (88 times higher than random expectation) is found between the two newest methods on the list, namely SVMs and random forests. We hypothesize that this is due to many researchers using these algorithms through machine learning frameworks such as Weka (Frank et al., 2004), which allows many different algorithms to easily be applied to the same dataset. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. \n \nHeatmap showing the co-occurrence of machine learning techniques within articles. \n \n \n \nApplications of supervised machine learning methodology continue to grow in the biomedical literature. Despite new methods growing in usage, for example support vector machines and random forests, we see little evidence that any widely adopted methods are falling out of use. \n \nConflict of Interest: none declared.", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 3, "citationCount": 40, "influentialCitationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2214567", "name": "L.

They show how some distinct choice of human behavior or preference influences a decision. They are also used to project future demand estimates to support policy exploration. This latter use for prediction is indirectly aligned with and conditional to the model's estimation which aims to fit the observed data. In contrast, machine learning models are derived to maximize prediction accuracy through mechanisms such as out-of-sample validation, non-linear structure, and automated covariate selection, albeit at the expense of interpretability and sound behavioral theory. We investigate how machine learning models can outperform discrete choice models for prediction of car ownership using transportation household survey data from Singapore. We compare our household car ownership model (multinomial logit model) against various machine learning models (e.g. Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) by using 2008 data to derive, i.e. estimate models that we then use to predict 2012 ownership. The machine learning models are inferior to the discrete choice model when using discrete choice features. However, after engineering features more appropriate for machine learning they are superior.

Recently, several approaches have been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These methods quantify the \u201cimportance\u201d of individual pixels with respect to the classification decision and allow a visualization in terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space.

We compare heatmaps computed by three different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012, and MIT Places data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach or the deconvolution method.

In this literature survey, we review existing work in both the machine learning and the natural language processing communities related to domain adaptation. Because this relatively new topic is constantly attracting attention, our survey is necessarily incomplete. Nevertheless, we try to cover the major lines of work that we are aware of up to the date this survey is written. This survey will also be constantly updated. The goal of this literature survey is twofold. First, existing studies on domain adaptation seem very different from each other, and different terms are used to refer to the problem. There has not been any survey that connects these different studies. This survey thus tries to organize the existing work in a systematic way and draw a big picture of the domain adaptation problem with its possible solutions.

Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n\u200a=\u200a34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n\u200a=\u200a12), hospital length of stay (n\u200a=\u200a7), hospital admission/triage (n\u200a=\u200a6), traumatic brain injury (n\u200a=\u200a4), life-saving interventions (n\u200a=\u200a5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n\u200a=\u200a4), and transfusion (n\u200a=\u200a1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma.

To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 100, "citationCount": 102, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2405396", "name": "Ehsan Toreini"}, {"authorId": "47301404", "name": "M.

Machine learning methods are renowned for dealing with these problems. To date machine learning methods have been applied in Genome-Wide Association Studies for identification of candidate genes, epistasis detection, gene network pathway analyses and genomic prediction of phenotypic values. However, the utility of two machine learning methods, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Method (XgBoost), in identifying a subset of SNP makers for genomic prediction of breeding values has never been explored before. In this study, using 38,082 SNP markers and body weight phenotypes from 2,093 Brahman cattle (1,097 bulls as a discovery population and 996 cows as a validation population), we examined the efficiency of three machine learning methods, namely Random Forests (RF), GBM and XgBoost, in (a) the identification of top 400, 1,000, and 3,000 ranked SNPs; (b) using the subsets of SNPs to construct genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) for the estimation of genomic breeding values (GEBVs). For comparison purposes, we also calculated the GEBVs from (1) 400, 1,000, and 3,000 SNPs that were randomly selected and evenly spaced across the genome, and (2) from all the SNPs. We found that RF and especially GBM are efficient methods in identifying a subset of SNPs with direct links to candidate genes affecting the growth trait. In comparison to the estimate of prediction accuracy of GEBVs from using all SNPs (0.43), the 3,000 top SNPs identified by RF (0.42) and GBM (0.46) had similar values to those of the whole SNP panel. The performance of the subsets of SNPs from RF and GBM was substantially better than that of evenly spaced subsets across the genome (0.18\u20130.29).

This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate distribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$ is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is $\\mu$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $\\mu / \\sqrt{n}$. \nThe algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector $X$, which can contain $k \\leq c \\min(\\sqrt{n}/\\mu \\log n, m^{1/2 -\\eta})$ non-zero entries (for any $\\eta > 0$). This is close to the best $k$ allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the dictionary $A$ exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on $\\log 1/\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on $1/\\epsilon$, and this is necessary.", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 63, "citationCount": 200, "influentialCitationCount": 21, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "145563465", "name": "Sanjeev Arora"}, {"authorId": "144804200", "name": "Rong Ge"}, {"authorId": "1690962", "name": "Ankur Moitra"}]}, {"paperId": "d80f949ebb04760fdff4bcb35180a48268324512", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d80f949ebb04760fdff4bcb35180a48268324512", "title": "Object-Based Image Classification of Summer Crops with Machine Learning Methods", "abstract": "The strategic management of agricultural lands involves crop field monitoring each year.

Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. While each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. More formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags X1, ..., Xm, with Xj = {xi : i \u2208 Ij} and Ij \u2286 {1, ..., n}. With each bag Xj is associated a label Yj \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. These labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label Yj = \u22121, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. If on the other hand, Yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi \u2208 Xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. The MIL scenario has many interesting applications: One prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (Dietterich, Lathrop, & LozanoPerez 1997). Here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. Another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (Maron & Ratan 1998) or image regions. Algorithms for the MIL problem were first presented in (Dietterich, Lathrop, & Lozano-Perez 1997; Auer 1997; Long & Tan 1996).

Within this framework, we discuss the task of learning to map utterances to logical forms (semantic parsing) and the task of learning from denotations with logical forms as latent variables.

MicroRNAs can be associated with disease; however, only a few microRNA-disease associations have been confirmed by traditional experimental approaches. We introduce two methods to predict microRNA-disease association. The first method, KATZ, focuses on integrating the social network analysis method with machine learning and is based on networks derived from known microRNA-disease associations, disease-disease associations, and microRNA-microRNA associations. The other method, CATAPULT, is a supervised machine learning method. We applied the two methods to 242 known microRNA-disease associations and evaluated their performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation.

In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given.

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real\u2010world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to\u2010date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 239, "citationCount": 68, "influentialCitationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "6609752", "name": "A.

Although classical machine learning techniques have successfully been applied to find informative genes and to predict class labels for new samples, common restrictions of microarray analysis such as small sample sizes, a large attribute space and high noise levels still limit its scientific and clinical applications. Increasing the interpretability of prediction models while retaining a high accuracy would help to exploit the information content in microarray data more effectively. For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification. A comparison with other benchmark microarray sample classifiers based on three diverse feature selection algorithms suggests that these evolutionary learning techniques can compete with state-of-the-art methods like support vector machines. The obtained models reach accuracies above 90% in two-level external cross-validation, with the added value of facilitating interpretation by using only combinations of simple if-then-else rules. As a further benefit, a literature mining analysis reveals that prioritizations of informative genes extracted from BioHEL\u2019s classification rule sets can outperform gene rankings obtained from a conventional ensemble feature selection in terms of the pointwise mutual information between relevant disease terms and the standardized names of top-ranked genes.", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 152, "citationCount": 107, "influentialCitationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "1806197", "name": "E.
