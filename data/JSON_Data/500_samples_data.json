Machine Learning offers an alternative approach to exploiting LOD's data with the advantages that Machine Learning algorithms are typically robust to both noise and data inconsistencies and are able to efficiently utilize non-deterministic dependencies in the data. From a Machine Learning point of view, LOD is challenging due to its relational nature and its scale. Here, we present an efficient approach to relational learning on LOD data, based on the factorization of a sparse tensor that scales to data consisting of millions of entities, hundreds of relations and billions of known facts. Furthermore, we show how ontological knowledge can be incorporated in the factorization to improve learning results and how computation can be distributed across multiple nodes. We demonstrate that our approach is able to factorize the YAGO~2 core ontology and globally predict statements for this large knowledge base using a single dual-core desktop computer. Furthermore, we show experimentally that our approach achieves good results in several relational learning tasks that are relevant to Linked Data.

Covariate shift, a particular case of dataset shift, occurs when only the input distribution changes. Dataset shift is present in most practical applications, for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by experimental design to the irreproducibility of the testing conditions at training time. (An example is -email spam filtering, which may fail to recognize spam that differs in form from the spam the automatic filter has been built on.) Despite this, and despite the attention given to the apparently similar problems of semi-supervised learning and active learning, dataset shift has received relatively little attention in the machine learning community until recently. This volume offers an overview of current efforts to deal with dataset and covariate shift. The chapters offer a mathematical and philosophical introduction to the problem, place dataset shift in relationship to transfer learning, transduction, local learning, active learning, and semi-supervised learning, provide theoretical views of dataset and covariate shift (including decision theoretic and Bayesian perspectives), and present algorithms for covariate shift.

Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas\u2013Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for l1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others.

Dealing with non-stationarity is one of modern machine learning's greatest challenges. This book focuses on a specific non-stationary environment known as covariate shift, in which the distributions of inputs (queries) change but the conditional distribution of outputs (answers) is unchanged, and presents machine learning theory, algorithms, and applications to overcome this variety of non-stationarity. After reviewing the state-of-the-art research in the field, the authors discuss topics that include learning under covariate shift, model selection, importance estimation, and active learning. They describe such real world applications of covariate shift adaption as brain-computer interface, speaker identification, and age prediction from facial images.

The obtained models are meant to be a synthetic representation of the available, observed data that captures some of their intrinsic regularities or patterns. Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis can be understood as a problem of pattern recognition or, more informally, of knowledge discovery and data mining. There exists a gap, though, between data modeling and knowledge extraction. Models, de- pending on the machine learning techniques employed, can be described in diverse ways but, in order to consider that some knowledge has been achieved from their description, we must take into account the human cog- nitive factor that any knowledge extraction process entails. These models as such can be rendered powerless unless they can be interpreted ,a nd the process of human interpretation follows rules that go well beyond techni- cal prowess. For this reason, interpretability is a paramount quality that machine learning methods should aim to achieve if they are to be applied in practice. This paper is a brief introduction to the special session on interpretable models in machine learning, organized as part of the 20 th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational In- telligence and Machine Learning.

The framework allows for automatically identifying novel classes of malware with similar behavior (clustering) and assigning unknown malware to these discovered classes (classification).

Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; and these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.

The authors examined the performance of various CART\u2010based propensity score models using simulated data. Hypothetical studies of varying sample sizes (n=500, 1000, 2000) with a binary exposure, continuous outcome, and 10 covariates were simulated under seven scenarios differing by degree of non\u2010linear and non\u2010additive associations between covariates and the exposure. Propensity score weights were estimated using logistic regression (all main effects), CART, pruned CART, and the ensemble methods of bagged CART, random forests, and boosted CART. Performance metrics included covariate balance, standard error, per cent absolute bias, and 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) coverage. All methods displayed generally acceptable performance under conditions of either non\u2010linearity or non\u2010additivity alone. However, under conditions of both moderate non\u2010additivity and moderate non\u2010linearity, logistic regression had subpar performance, whereas ensemble methods provided substantially better bias reduction and more consistent 95 per cent CI coverage. The results suggest that ensemble methods, especially boosted CART, may be useful for propensity score weighting.

We will take a closer look at them in Section 1.3. A task is an abstract representation of a problem we want to solve regarding those domain objects: the most common form of these is classifying them into two or more classes, but we shall encounter other tasks throughout the book. Many of these tasks can be represented as a mapping from data points to outputs. This mapping or model is itself produced as the output of a machine learning algorithm applied to training data; there is a wide variety of models to choose from, as we shall see in Section 1.2.

As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.", "year": 2003, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 1737, "influentialCitationCount": 122, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2016191", "name": "J.

In practice, the rule growing and pruning are carried out merely benefiting from a small snapshot of the complete training data to truncate the computational load and memory demand to the low level. An exposure of a novel algorithm, namely parsimonious network based on fuzzy inference system (PANFIS), is to this end presented herein. PANFIS can commence its learning process from scratch with an empty rule base. The fuzzy rules can be stitched up and expelled by virtue of statistical contributions of the fuzzy rules and injected datum afterward. Identical fuzzy sets may be alluded and blended to be one fuzzy set as a pursuit of a transparent rule base escalating human's interpretability. The learning and modeling performances of the proposed PANFIS are numerically validated using several benchmark problems from real-world or synthetic datasets.

We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deployment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.).

Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as ridge regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel data. This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps. While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the small number of examples work to our advantage. We propose both closed-form and iterative solvers, based on ridge regression and logistic regression components. Our methods constitute a simple and novel approach to the problem of few-shot learning and achieve performance competitive with or superior to the state of the art on three benchmarks.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 73, "citationCount": 548, "influentialCitationCount": 161, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "authors": [{"authorId": "2271057", "name": "Luca Bertinetto"}, {"authorId": "143848064", "name": "Jo\u00e3o F.

We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels).

In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of \"posterior collapse\" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework.

In the era of big machinery data, data-driven MHMS have achieved remarkable results in the detection of faults after the occurrence of certain failures (diagnosis) and prediction of the future working conditions and the remaining useful life (prognosis). The numerical representation for raw sensory data is the key stone for various successful MHMS. Conventional methods are the labor-extensive as they usually depend on handcrafted features, which require expert knowledge. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods that redefine representation learning from raw data, we propose local feature-based gated recurrent unit (LFGRU) networks. It is a hybrid approach that combines handcrafted feature design with automatic feature learning for machine health monitoring. First, features from windows of input time series are extracted. Then, an enhanced bidirectional GRU network is designed and applied on the generated sequence of local features to learn the representation. A supervised learning layer is finally trained to predict machine condition. Experiments on three machine health monitoring tasks: tool wear prediction, gearbox fault diagnosis, and incipient bearing fault detection verify the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed LFGRU.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 412, "influentialCitationCount": 23, "isOpenAccess": false, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "authors": [{"authorId": "49832912", "name": "Rui Zhao"}, {"authorId": "2047932486", "name": "Dongzhe Wang"}, {"authorId": "35374692", "name": "Ruqiang Yan"}, {"authorId": "144067957", "name": "K.

In particular, deep learning has proven to be both a major breakthrough and an extremely powerful tool in many fields. Shall we embrace deep learning as the key to everything? Or should we resist a black-box solution? These are controversial issues within the remote-sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of using deep learning for remote-sensing data analysis, review recent advances, and provide resources we hope will make deep learning in remote sensing seem ridiculously simple. More importantly, we encourage remote-sensing scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning and use it as an implicit general model to tackle unprecedented, large-scale, influential challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 216, "citationCount": 1272, "influentialCitationCount": 42, "isOpenAccess": true, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "authors": [{"authorId": "46875441", "name": "Xiaoxiang Zhu"}, {"authorId": "2977931", "name": "D.
